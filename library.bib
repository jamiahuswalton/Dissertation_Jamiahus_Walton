abstract = {Modern day teams, whether in the military or civilian workplace, have the ability to achieve goals that are otherwise unobtainable by individuals. The timing and characteristics of feedback that teams receive during training are critical. Though there is a solid foundation of research on optimal feedback, there is limited exploration of what constitutes ideal team feedback including addressing the individual team member versus the whole team and whether that feedback is public (visible to the entire team) or private (visible only to one member of the team). Previous research that studied the effect of feedback on team performance has yielded slightly different conclusions. For example, research focused on the privacy of feedback suggests that public feedback can have a motivational effect that improves performance. The aim of this work is to discover the most effective combination of the target and privacy of feedback. To accomplish this goal a modified version of the Multiple Errands Test (MET) was developed to evaluate the performance of three-member teams, the Team MET (TMET). The MET, normally used for evaluating cognitive processing, requires that specific rules be followed while completing multiple tasks within a time constraint. Participants performed the TMET while coordinating purchases in a virtual mall. In each of four timed shopping sessions, participants received feedback on their performance as an individual and team. Feedback was given in one of four conditions: individual private, team private, individual public, and team public. Task performance and rule errors were measured as dependent variables. Results did not yield a broadly significant effect of feedback condition on team or individual performance. However, the study did demonstrate the validity of the TMET as a platform for assessing a team's ability to perform under heavy cognitive load.},

@article{Moreland2000,
abstract = {Several experiments (see Hollingshead, 1998a; Moreland, 1999) have shown that groups perform tasks better if their members are trained together rather than apart. The performance benefits of group training have been attributed to the development of transactive memory systems. This experiment tested whether such benefits are due instead to improved communication among group members. The results indicated that they are not. Groups whose members were trained apart, with no chance to communicate with one another, performed well after receiving information about one another's skills. Their performance was comparable to that of groups whose members were trained together, and both types of groups performed significantly better than did groups whose members were trained apart. The relationship between transactive memory and communication processes was discussed briefly, along with the prospect of using feedback about workers' skills to create transactive memory systems in large organizations as well as in small groups. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The goal of research and development in Information Technology for Leader and Team Learning and Operations is to use what we know from cognitive science and cognitive engineering to increase the readiness and adaptive performance of leaders and teams in real-world missions. Special emphasis is given to preparation and functions in Stability and Support Operations (SASO) missions. The government wants to increase the efficiency and the effectiveness with which units prepare for deployment and performance of SASO missions by applying cognitive science to the process. It is commonplace for organizations to assert that they want to encourage their teams to be adaptive. The military in particular places a high value on having adaptive teams, as opposed to rigid, inflexible teams, because there is so much uncertainty on the battlefield that it is essential to have units that can adjust to changing conditions. In addition, the military organization is taking on new roles in peacekeeping and SASO missions, and there is a significant learning curve involved in preparing to handle these challenges. Yet little has been written about what it means to be an adaptive team.},

abstract = {One role of state-level Departments of Transportation (DOT) is traffic incident management (TIM): managing incidents that impact traffic flow on interstate highways and involving multiple agencies (e.g., police, fire). This study found DOTs collect basic TIM performance measures (e.g., lane clearance times), but many do not record additional measures, consistently review the collected data or analyze it unless needed to answer specific questions. Since performance evaluation of interagency coordination is one area of TIM in which little success has been attained (FHWA, 2003), process improvement methods from operations management may prove useful. To illustrate, interagency incident response for a disabled vehicle (no injuries or property damage) is modeled as a process in which appropriate resources (e.g., state police, tow) must coordinate to safely remove the vehicle and restore normal traffic flow. Completing these events requires the resources to perform specific functions, each taking more or less time depending on various factors (e.g., weather, time of day). Response time data can highlight geographic areas or process segments with highly variable event times, leading to investigation and recommendations to reduce variability and, ultimately, traffic delays. Based on this approach, recommendations are made for data collection and analysis of appropriate TIM performance measures.},

abstract = {To function effectively, a team must act as an information-processing unit, maintaining an awareness of the situation or context in which it is functioning and acquiring and using information to act in that situation. This team cognition differs from individual cognition, of course, because each team member acts as an individual information processor. For a team to act in concert to achieve common goals, the team must have shared information about both the situation and the other team members. Team cognition thus requires communication-a process that has no direct analog in individual cognition-in order for the team to build and maintain a shared mental model of the situation. Because communication is essential to team performance, effective team cognition has a communication "overhead" associated with the exchange of information among team members. Communication requires both time and cognitive resources, and, to the extent that communication can be made less necessary or more efficient, team performance can benefit as a result.},

@article{Wiser2016,
abstract = {We model scenarios of the U.S. electric sector in which wind generation reaches 10{\%} of end-use electricity demand in 2020, 20{\%} in 2030, and 35{\%} in 2050. As shown in a companion paper, achieving these penetration levels would have significant implications for the wind industry and the broader electric sector. Compared to a baseline that assumes no new wind deployment, under the primary scenario modeled, achieving these penetrations imposes an incremental cost to electricity consumers of less than 1{\%} through 2030. These cost implications, however, should be balanced against the variety of environmental and social implications of such a scenario. Relative to a baseline that assumes no new wind deployment, our analysis shows that the high-penetration wind scenario yields potential greenhouse-gas benefits of {\$}85???{\$}1,230 billion in present-value terms, with a central estimate of {\$}400 billion. Air-pollution-related health benefits are estimated at {\$}52???{\$}272 billion, while annual electric-sector water withdrawals and consumption are lower by 15{\%} and 23{\%} in 2050, respectively. We also find that a high-wind-energy future would have implications for the diversity and risk of energy supply, local economic development, and land use and related local impacts on communities and ecosystems; however, these additional impacts may not greatly affect aggregate social welfare owing to their nature, in part, as resource transfers.},

abstract = {This article examines the importance of national and sub-national policies in supporting the development of successful global wind turbine manufacturing companies. We explore the motivations behind establishing a local wind power industry, and the paths that different countries have taken to develop indigenous large wind turbine manufacturing industries within their borders. This is done through a cross-country comparison of the policy support mechanisms that have been employed to directly and indirectly promote wind technology manufacturing in 12 countries. We find that in many instances there is a clear relationship between a manufacturer's success in its home country market and its eventual success in the global wind power market. Whether new wind turbine manufacturing entrants are able to succeed will likely depend in part on the utilization of their turbines in their own domestic market, which in turn will be influenced by the annual size and stability of that market. Consequently, policies that support a sizable, stable market for wind power, in conjunction with policies that specifically provide incentives for wind power technology to be manufactured locally, are most likely to result in the establishment of an internationally competitive wind industry.},

Training outcomes included declarative knowledge, knowledge structure coherence, training performance, and self-efficacy. We also examined the unique impact of the training outcomes on performance adaptability by predicting generalization to a more difficult and complex version of the task. The experiment involved 60 trainees learning a complex computer simulation over 2 days. The research model posited independent effects for training goals relative to goal orientation traits and independent contributions of training outcomes to the performance adaptability of trainees. The findings were consistent with the proposed model. In particular, self-efficacy and knowledge structure coherence made unique contributions to the prediction of performance adaptability after controlling for prior training performance and declarative knowledge. Implications and extensions are discussed. Copyright 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {This note addresses the confounding of the term 'presence' with several different distinct aspects of experience. Distinctions should be made between immersion, presence, involvement, emotional response, degree of interest. An analogy with colour science is pursued, specifically the difference between wavelength distribution and perception of colour - where the former is like 'immersion' the latter is like 'presence' (a human response). On top of this colours may be experienced as interesting, emotion-producing and so on. Just as the emotional experience engendered by a colour is not the same as the perception of the colour, which is not a simple function of the wavelength distribution, so involvement, interest or emotional response in a virtual reality is not the same as presence, which is not the same as immersion.},

The data were collected and processed according to a procedure defined for course-of-action analysis. The resultswere used to characterize the coordination modes among players and the team coordination network that was built. The processes that underlie team coordination are discussed (i.e., mutuality and awareness), and some directions for practical applications are addressed.},

Specifically, we focus on mental health communities on reddit. We investigate the characteristics of mental health discourse manifested through reddit's characteristic ‘throwaway' accounts, which are used as proxies of anonymity. For the purpose, we propose affective, cognitive, social, and linguistic style measures, drawing from literature in psychology. We observe that mental health discourse from throwaways is considerably disinhibiting and exhibits increased negativity, cognitive bias and self-attentional focus, and lowered self-esteem. Throwaways also seem to be six times more prevalent as an identity choice on mental health forums, compared to other reddit communities. We discuss the implications of our work in guiding mental health interventions, and in the design of online communities that can better cater to the needs of vulnerable populations. We conclude with thoughts on the role of identity manifestation on social media in behavioral therapy.},

@book{Jonassen1989,
abstract = {The major reason for this book is our belief that task analysis is the single most important component process in instructional systems design (ISD). Yet there is less literature available on task analysis than on any other component of ISD. ISD usually begins by analyzing the needs of the learner in the given instructional situation. Having identified learning needs and determined outcomes from them, the instructional designer conducts the task analysis. This book is designed to serve three purposes. The first purpose is to define task analysis. In the first part of the book, we define both a structure and a process. The definition of the latter includes a description of the functions of task analysis and the situational variables that affect its performance. Next, the book describes virtually all of the known techniques used to perform task analysis. Each is not described in complete detail because of space limitations. The techniques are grouped in subsequent parts of the book by the type of analysis they best support—learning, job, and subject matter. In the final part of the book, we describe the information-gathering tools that support the techniques. The second purpose of this book is to serve as an instructional text. In each chapter we use text, flowcharts, and examples to describe how to perform a specific task analysis technique. The third purpose of this book is to serve as a reference book of task analysis. Each chapter has a similar structure with headings and other typographic cues that help you to find information about each technique. These cues should enable you [to] find the information you want.

abstract = {Prior research on backing-up behavior has indicated that it is beneficial to teams (C. O. L. H. Porter, 2005; C. O. L. H. Porter et al., 2003). This literature has focused on how backing-up behavior aids backup recipients in tasks in which workload is unevenly distributed among team members. The authors of the present study examined different contexts of workload distribution and found that, in addition to the initial benefits to backup recipients, there are initial and subsequent costs. Backing-up behavior leads backup providers to neglect their own taskwork, especially when workload is evenly distributed. Team members who receive high amounts of backing-up behavior decrease their taskwork in a subsequent task, especially when a team member can observe their workload. These findings indicate that it is important to consider both the benefits and costs of engaging in backing-up behavior.},

In particular, the MET is an assessment of executive functions in daily life, which consists of tasks that abide by certain rules and is performed in a shopping mall-like setting where items need to be bought and information needs to be obtained. The study population included three groups: post-stroke participants (n = 5), healthy, young participants (n = 5), and healthy, older participants (n = 5). Specific objectives were (1) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) and at the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions and (2) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy, young controls and older controls in the VMET and at the traditional neuropsychological tests employed to assess executive functions.},

abstract = {In a previous examination of feedback research (Mory, 1996), the use of feedback in the facilitation of learning was examined extensively according to various historical and paradigmatic views of the past feedback literature. Most of the research presented in that volume in the area of feedbackwas completed with specific assumptions as to what purpose feedback serves. This still holds true, and even more so, because our theories and paradigms have expanded, and the field of instructional design has undergone and will continue to undergo rapid changes in technologies that will afford new advances to take place in both the delivery and the context of using feedback in instruction. It is not surprising that feedback may have various functions according to the particular learning environment in which it is examined and the particular learning paradigm under which it is viewed. In fact, feedback is incorporated in many paradigms of learning, from the early views of behaviorism (Skinner, 1958), to cognitivism (Gagne, 1985; Kulhavy {\&} Wager 1993) through more recent models of constructivism (Jonassen, 1991, 1999; Mayer, 1999; Willis, 2000), settings such as open learning environments (Hannafin, Land, {\&} Oliver, 1999), and views that support multiple approaches to understanding (Gardner, 1999), to name just a few. While feedback has been an essential element of theories of learning and instruction in the past (Bangert-Drowns, Kulik, Kulik, {\&} Morgan, 1991), it still pervades the literature and instructional models as an important aspect of instruction (Collis, De Boer, {\&} Slotman, 2001; Dick, Carey, {\&} Carey, 2001).},

abstract = {In an effort to make the social dimensions of energy conversion and use more visible, this article investigates the cultural barriers to energy efficiency technologies and devices and renewable power generators in the United States. To discover the cultural impediments to these technologies, the author conducted 181 formal, semi-structured interviews at more than 82 institutions (including electric utilities, regulatory agencies, interest groups, energy systems manufacturers, nonprofit organizations, consulting firms, universities, national laboratories, and state institutions) from 2005 to 2008. These interviews were supplemented with an extensive literature review. The study finds that the apparent disconnect between how electricity is made and how it is socially perceived perpetuates public apathy and misinformation about it; also that deeply held values related to consumption, abundance, trust, control, and freedom shape American attitudes toward energy. As a result, wind farms and solar panels (along with other renewable power systems) are often opposed not because they are a poor alternative to fossil fuels, but because people simply do not comprehend why such technologies may be needed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An experimen- tal study in a laboratory was conducted with 54 teams randomly assigned to a team feedback condition or a control condition. Results provided empirical support to the moderated mediation model. We found that the indirect effect of team feedback on team learning via group information elaboration occurred in virtual teams with a high level of team trust. However, this indirect effect was not statistically significant in virtual teams with lower levels of team trust. Additionally, we also found that group information elab- oration and team learning were positively related in virtual teams. Therefore, our findings suggest that team feedback is effective to improve group information elaboration and learning in virtual teams when team trust is high. ?},

Two-hundred thirty-seven undergraduates from a large mid-Atlantic university formed 79 three-member tank platoon teams and participated in a low-fidelity tank simulation. Team-interaction training, leader briefings, and novelty of performance environment were manipulated. Findings indicated that both leader briefings and team-interaction training affected the development of mental models, which in turn positively influenced team communication processes and team performance. Mental models and communication processes predicted performance more strongly in novel than in routine environments.

abstract = {There is a growing literature on the relationship between team processes and clinical performance. The purpose of this review is to summarize these articles and examine the impact of team process behaviours on clinical performance. We conducted a literature search in five major databases. Inclusion criteria were: English peer-reviewed papers published between January 2001 and May 2012, which showed or tried to show (i) a statistical relationship of a team process variable and clinical performance or (ii) an improvement of a performance variable through a team process intervention. Study quality was assessed using predefined quality indicators. For every study, we calculated the relevant effect sizes. We included 28 studies in the review, seven of which were intervention studies. Every study reported at least one significant relationship between team processes or an intervention and performance. Also, some non-significant effects were reported. Most of the reported effect sizes were large or medium. The study quality ranged from medium to high. The studies are highly diverse regarding the specific team process behaviours investigated and also regarding the methods used. However, they suggest that team process behaviours do influence clinical performance and that training results in increased performance. Future research should rely on existing theoretical frameworks, valid, and reliable methods to assess processes such as teamwork or coordination and focus on the development of adequate tools to assess process performance, linking them with outcomes in the clinical setting.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This research effort leveraged the science of training to guide a taxonomic integration and a series of meta-analyses to gauge the effectiveness and boundary conditions of team training interventions for enhancing team outcomes. BACKGROUND: Disparate effect sizes across primary studies have made it difficult to determine the true strength of the relationships between team training techniques and team outcomes. METHOD: Several meta-analytic integrations were conducted to examine the relationships between team training interventions and team functioning. Specifically, we assessed the relative effectiveness of these interventions on team cognitive, affective, process, and performance outcomes. Training content, team membership stability, and team size were investigated as potential moderators of the relationship between team training and outcomes. In total, the database consisted of 93 effect sizes representing 2650 teams. RESULTS: The results suggested that moderate, positive relationships exist between team training interventions and each of the outcome types. The findings of moderator analyses indicated that training content, team membership stability, and team size moderate the effectiveness of these interventions. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that team training interventions are a viable approach organizations can take in order to enhance team outcomes. They are useful for improving cognitive outcomes, affective outcomes, teamwork processes, and performance outcomes. Moreover, results suggest that training content, team membership stability, and team size moderate the effectiveness of team training interventions. APPLICATION: Applications of the results from this research are numerous. Those who design and administer training can benefit from these findings in order to improve the effectiveness of their team training interventions.},

Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition.

abstract = {How can we optimally trade extra computing power to reduce the communication load in distributed computing? We answer this question by characterizing a fundamental tradeoff relationship between computation and communication in distributed computing, i.e., the two are inverse-linearly proportional to each other. More specifically, a general distributed computing framework, motivated by commonly used structures like MapReduce, is considered, where the goal is to compute {\$}Q{\$} arbitrary output functions from {\$}N{\$} input files, by decomposing the overall computation into computing a set of "Map" and "Reduce" functions distributedly across {\$}K{\$} computing nodes. A coded scheme, named "Coded Distributed Computing" (CDC), is proposed to demonstrate that increasing the computation load of the Map phase by a factor of {\$}r{\$} (i.e., evaluating each Map function at {\$}r{\$} carefully chosen nodes) can create novel coding opportunities in the data shuffling phase that reduce the communication load by the same factor. An information-theoretic lower bound on the communication load is also provided, which matches the communication load achieved by the CDC scheme. As a result, the optimal computation-communication tradeoff in distributed computing is exactly characterized.},

abstract = {Past research suggests that autonomy has highly variable effects on team performance, and that one explanation for this pattern of findings is that autonomous teams fall into a state of disorder where they lack clarity regarding the goals of the broader organization. Following this perspective, the authors develop a model proposing that performance feedback coupled with high autonomy enables teams to have greater clarity of the organization's goals, which in turn increases team performance. This model was tested on 110 teams in a defense industry manufacturing firm in South Korea using mediated-moderation techniques. Results indicate that highly autonomous teams that receive a high degree of performance feedback outperform other teams because of their heightened level of organizational goal clarity. In contrast, highly autonomous teams that receive low levels of feedback perform at the lowest levels compared to other teams because of a lack of organizational goal clarity. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for theory, research, and practice.},

While this approach may promote clinical competency, it does not actively develop students' competency in facilitating feedback discussions and providing feedback across power differentials (ie, from student to preceptor). This latter competency warrants particular attention given its fundamental role in effective health care team communication and its related influence on patient safety. Reframing the feedback process as collaborative and bidirectional, where both preceptors and students provide and receive feedback, maximizes opportunities for role modeling and skills practice in the context of a supportive relationship, thereby enhancing team preparedness. We describe an initiative to introduce these fundamental skills of collaborative, bidirectional feedback in the nurse-midwifery education program at the University of California, San Francisco.},

abstract = {This study responds to a question that people working in the field of learning sciences get asked regularly: What do learning scientists do? Earlier attempts to answer this question came from a need to define a new field of educational research. Now that the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) has grown into a robust and productive society, it is time to gain a more nuanced understanding of learning sciences research and practices—including where it takes place, for whom, and in what form—as defined by members of the learning sciences community. Here we report on the responses of 253 ISLS members to a survey conducted in 2014. We discuss implications of the findings in terms of the type of impact learning scientists have. We also discuss how these results might be used to advise prospective students and to create a vision for our future.},

abstract = {Purpose: This article aims to draw on experience in supervising new researchers, and the advice of other writers to offer novice researchers such as those engaged in study for a thesis, or in another small-scale research project, a pragmatic introduction to designing and using research questionnaires. Design/methodology/approach: After a brief introduction, this article is organized into three main sections: designing questionnaires, distributing questionnaires, and analysing and presenting questionnaire data. Within these sections, ten questions often asked by novice researchers are posed and answered. Findings: This article is designed to give novice researchers advice and support to help them to design good questionnaires, to maximise their response rate, and to undertake appropriate data analysis. Originality/value: Other research methods texts offer advice on questionnaire design and use, but their advice is not specifically tailored to new researchers. They tend to offer options, but provide limited guidance on making crucial decisions in questionnaire design, distribution and data analysis and presentation. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

However, few studies have provided empirical evidence that this strategy results in increased use of teamwork behaviors. The current paper describes 2 evaluation studies of CRM training that were conducted with a total of 96 naval aviators and followed a multiple assessment approach. Results indicate that highly experienced aviators benefited from the training, which focused on increasing the use of several critical teamwork skills. These rare evaluation data suggest that CRM training is a viable strategy for improving teamwork in the cockpit. Implications for team training are discussed.

Optimizing retrieval practice has been assumed, on the basis of evidence and arguments tracing back to Landauer and Bjork (1978), to require an expanding-interval schedule of successive retrievals, but recent findings suggest that expanding retrieval practice may be inferior to uniform-interval retrieval practice when memory is tested after a long retention interval. We report three experiments in which participants read educational passages and were then repeatedly tested, without feedback, after an expanding or uniform sequence of intervals. On a test 1 week later, recall was enhanced by the expanding schedule, but only when the task between successive retrievals was highly interfering with memory for the passage. These results suggest that the extent to which learners benefit from expanding retrieval practice depends on the degree to which the to-belearned information is vulnerable to forgetting.},

abstract = {This article describes the use of principles of reinforcement learning to design feedback controllers for discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems that combine features of adaptive control and optimal control. Adaptive control [1], [2] and optimal control [3] represent different philosophies for designing feedback controllers. Optimal controllers are normally designed of ine by solving Hamilton JacobiBellman (HJB) equations, for example, the Riccati equation, using complete knowledge of the system dynamics. Determining optimal control policies for nonlinear systems requires the offline solution of nonlinear HJB equations, which are often difficult or impossible to solve. By contrast, adaptive controllers learn online to control unknown systems using data measured in real time along the system trajectories. Adaptive controllers are not usually designed to be optimal in the sense of minimizing user-prescribed performance functions. Indirect adaptive controllers use system identification techniques to first identify the system parameters and then use the obtained model to solve optimal design equations [1]. Adaptive controllers may satisfy certain inverse optimality conditions [4].},

We investigated experimentally the effects of cooperating partners being in the same or distant city on three behaviors: cooperation, persuasion, and deception using video conferencing and instant messaging (IM). Our results indicate that subjects are more likely to deceive, be less persuaded by, and initially cooperate less, with someone they believe is in a distant city, as opposed to in the same city as them. Although people initially cooperate less with someone they believe is far away, their willingness to cooperate increases quickly with interaction. Since the same media were used in both the far and near city conditions, these effects cannot be attributed to the media, but rather to social differences. This study confirms how CSCW needs to be concerned with developing technologies for bridging social distance, as well as geographic distance.},

Two research prototypes sup- porting speech and gestural interactions have been developed on the basis of the User Centred Design methodology, and their evaluations have been conducted through user studies. The user studies on the prototypes suggest that multimodal UIs (MMUIs) can provide traffic control oper- ators with intuitive, cognitively efficient ways to record traffic incident conditions, facilitate fast retrieval of contact details, and support time-critical incident handling. The research prototypes described herein represent some initial steps for the longer-term deployment of advanced MMUI systems for emergency management.},

It identifies situations in the journey's three phases, pre-, on- and post-trip that have the potential to change travel patterns and also transport choices that the individual makes in order to perform activities in their daily life. Requirements on a traveler information system were derived from these situations and choices. The identified requirements are then transferred into functionalities in a travel information system that has potentials to encourage decisions that could lead to lower energy usage. Nine traveler information systems for multimodal and public transport travel are systematically investigated to find out if they include the proposed functionality. The investigated systems are in operation primarily in Sweden, Germany, the UK and one has global coverage. The investigation results in a discussion about future opportunities with proposal to encourage sustainability oriented travel decisions in the next generation travel information system. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {If renewable power systems deliver such impressive benefits, why do they still provide only 3 percent of national electricity generation in the United States? As an answer, this article demonstrates that the impediments to renewable power are socio-technical, a term that encompasses the technological, social, political, regulatory, and cultural aspects of electricity supply and use. Extensive interviews of public utility commissioners, utility managers, system operators, manufacturers, researchers, business owners, and ordinary consumers reveal that it is these socio-technical barriers that often explain why wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and hydroelectric power sources are not embraced. Utility operators reject renewable resources because they are trained to think only in terms of big, conventional power plants. Consumers practically ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption. Intentional market distortions (such as subsidies), and unintentional market distortions (such as split incentives) prevent consumers from becoming fully invested in their electricity choices. As a result, newer and cleaner technologies that may offer social and environmental benefits but are not consistent with the dominant paradigm of the electricity industry continue to face comparative rejection. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {NASA-TLX is a multi-dimensional scale designed to obtain workload estimates from one or more operators while they are performing a task or immediately afterwards. The years of research that preceded subscale selection and the weighted averaging approach resulted in a tool that has proven to be reasonably easy to use and reliably sensitive to experimentally important manipulations over the past 20 years. Its use has spread far beyond its original application (aviation), focus (crew complement), and language (English). This survey of 550 studies in which NASA-TLX was used or reviewed was undertaken to provide a resource for a new generation of users. The goal was to summarize the environments in which it has been applied, the types of activities the raters performed, other variables that were measured that did (or did not) covary, methodological issues, and lessons learned},

abstract = {Context:Little is known about best practices for teaching and learning leadership through Team-Based learning™ (TBL™) with medical students. We hypothesized that guided reflection and feedback would improve shared leadership and shared leadership capacity, and enhance team decision quality in TBL teams. We used the Kolb experiential learning theory as the theoretical framework. Method:The study was conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Three TBL sessions with 206 students (39 teams) participated in the study. Using a quasi-experimental design, one batch received guided reflection and feedback on their team leadership processes (n = 20 teams) and the other received only TBL (n = 19 teams). Observers measured shared leadership using a checklist. Shared leadership capacity was measured using a questionnaire. Scores on a team application exercise were used to assess quality of team decisions. Results:Evidence did not support our first hypothesis that reflection and feedback enhance shared leadership in TBL teams. Percentages of teams displaying shared leadership did not differ between intervention and control groups in sessions 1 (p = 0.6), 2 (p = 1) or 3 (p = 1). The results did not support the second hypothesis. We found no difference in quality of decision making between the intervention and control groups for sessions 1 (p = 0.77), 2 (p = 0.23), or 3 (p = 0.07). The third hypothesis that the reflection and feedback would have an effect on shared leadership capacity was supported (T = −8.55,p {\textgreater} 0.001 adjusted on baseline; T = −8.55,p {\textgreater} 0.001 adjusted on gender). Discussion and conclusion: We found that reflection and feedback improved shared leadership capacity but not shared leadership behaviors or team decision quality. We propose medical educators who apply TBL, should provide guided exercise in reflection and feedback so that students may better understand the benefits of working in teams as preparation for their future roles as leaders and members of health care teams.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to establish ecological validity and initial construct validity of a Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET) as an assessment tool for executive functions. It was implemented within the Virtual Mall (VMall), a novel functional video-capture virtual shopping environment. The main objectives were (1) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Multiple Errands Test (MET) carried out in a real shopping mall and their performance in the VMET, (2) to assess the relationships between the MET and VMET of the post-stroke participant's level of executive functioning and independence in instrumental activities of daily living, and (3) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young and older controls in both the MET and VMET. The study population included three groups; post-stroke participants (n = 9), healthy young participants (n = 20), and healthy older participants (n = 20). The VMET was able to differentiate between two age groups of healthy participants and between healthy and post-stroke participants thus demonstrating that it is sensitive to brain injury and ageing and supports construct validity between known groups. In addition, significant correlations were found between the MET and the VMET for both the post-stroke participants and older healthy participants. This provides initial support for the ecological validity of the VMET as an assessment tool of executive functions. However, further psychometric data on temporal stability are needed, namely test-retest reliability and responsiveness, before it is ready for clinical application. Further research using the VMET as an assessment tool within the VMall with larger groups and in additional populations is also recommended.},

As a result, science, industry, and even individuals have to face the challenge of dealing with large datasets which are too big for manual analysis. While these large " mountains " of data are easily produced nowadays, it remains difficult to automatically " mine " for valuable information within them.

In the first two studies, we investigated the effect of exposing subject aviators to standardized, behavior-based training for improving team coordination and performance. In the third study, we investigated the effect of increased intrateam familiarity (battle rostering) on team coordination and performance. In these studies, we measured effect in terms of attitudinal change, coordination behavior change, and team task performance change. The general findings suggest that standardized, behavior-based training produces team coordination and performance superior to that achieved through battle rostering. Findings also demonstrate that behavioral change is a more reliable marker of training impact than attitudinal change.},

abstract = {A current debate in psycholinguistics concerns how speakers take addressees' knowledge or needs into account during the packaging of utterances. In retelling stories, speakers are more likely to mention atypical instruments than easily inferrable, typical instruments; in a seminal study, Brown and Dell (1987) suggested that this is not an adjustment to addressees but is simply easiest for speakers. They concluded that manipulating addressees' knowledge did not affect speakers' mention of instruments. However, their addressees were confederates who heard the same stories repeatedly. We had speakers retell stories to naive addressees who either saw or did not see a picture illustrating the main action and instrument. When addressees lacked pictures, speakers were more likely to mention atypical instruments, to mention them early (within the same clause as the action verb), and to mark atypical instruments as indefinite. This suggests that with visual copresence, speakers can take addressees' knowledge into account in early syntactic choices.},

Due to the expense and logistics involved with operating actual systems, training and practice is: often difficult to obtain in other than an {\&}ldquo;on the job{\&}rdquo; fashion. To remedy this situation, a virtual environment (VE) based system is being developed for the training of ROV piloting skills. Analysis of typical missions such as mine countermeasures and search/salvage yielded a set of general skills to be taught including manoeuvring, situational awareness, sensor data integration, and mission operations. Use of VE technology permits the creation of an enriched learning environment including simulation of a wide range of operational environments, vehicle configurations, learning aids, rind mission scenarios. The prototype training system is a VE-based Intelligent Tutor which implements various training aids and interventions to promote the development of both the sensorimotor and cognitive skills related to basic manoeuvring tasks and situational awareness. Once implemented, the training effectiveness of this prototype will be studied by analyzing pilot performance on an actual ROV},

abstract = {Most modern research on the effects of feedback during learning assumes that feedback is an error correction mechanism. Recent studies of feedback timing effects suggest that feedback might also strengthen initially correct responses. In an experiment using cued recall of trivia facts, we directly tested several theories of feedback timing effects and also examined the effects of restudy and retest trials following immediate and delayed feedback. Results were not consistent with theories assuming that the only function of feedback is to correct initial errors but instead supported a theoretical account assuming that delaying feedback strengthens initially correct responses due to the spacing of encoding opportunities: Delaying feedback increased the probability of correct response perseveration on the final retention test but had minimal effects on error correction or error perseveration probabilities. In a second experiment, the effects of varying the lags between study, test, and feedback trials during learning provided further support for the spacing hypothesis},

abstract = {Digital games are very popular in modern culture. We have been examining ways to leverage these engaging environments to assess and support important stu-dent competencies, especially those that are not optimally measured by traditional assessment formats. In this chapter, we describe a particular approach for assessing and supporting student learning in game environments—stealth assessment—that entails unobtrusively embedding assessments directly and invisibly into the gaming environment. Results of the assessment can be used for adaptation in the form of scaffolding, hints, and providing appropriately challenging levels. We delineate the main steps of game-based stealth assessment and illustrate the implementation of these steps via two cases. The first case focuses on developing stealth assessment for problem-solving skills in an existing game. The second case describes the integra-tion of game and assessment design throughout game development, and the assess-ment and support of mathematical knowledge and skills. Both cases illustrate the applicability of data-driven, performance-based assessment in an interactive game as the basis for adaptation and for use in formal and informal contexts. According to " 2015 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry " published by Entertainment Software Association, over 150 million Americans play video games and 42 {\%} play regularly for at least 3 h per week. The popularity of video games has drawn researchers' attention in the exploration of the possibility of using video games to enhance knowledge, skills, and other personal attributes.

Many of the arguments designed to choose between the various philosophies have appealed, at least implicitly, to the behavior of effective human teachers. In this article, we compare the guidance and support offered by human tutors with that offered by intelligent tutoring systems. First, we review research on human tutoring strategies in various domains. Then we investigate the capabilities of a widely used technique for providing feedback, model tracing. Finally, we contrast the types of guidance and support provided by human tutors with those in intelligent tutoring systems, by examining the process of recovering from impasses encountered during problem solving. In general, the support offered by human tutors is more flexible and more subtle than that offered by model tracing tutors, but the two are more similar than sometimes argued.

abstract = {Experiments that aim to model language processing in spoken dialogue contexts often use confederates as speakers or addressees. However, the decision of whether to use a confederate, and of precisely how to deploy one, is shaped by researchers' explicit theories and implicit assumptions about the nature of dialogue. When can a confederate fulfill the role of conversational partner without changing the nature of the dialogue itself? We survey the benefits and risks of using confederates in studies of language in dialogue contexts, identifying four concerns that appear to guide how confederates are deployed. We then discuss several studies that have addressed these concerns differently-and, in some cases, have found different results. We conclude with recommendations for how to weigh the benefits and risks of using experimental confederates in dialogue studies: Confederates are best used when an experimental hypothesis concerns responses to unusual behaviors or low-frequency linguistic forms and when the experimental task calls for the confederate partner to take the initiative as speaker. Confederates can be especially risky in the addressee role, especially if their nonverbal behavior is uncontrolled and if they know more than is warranted by the experimental task.},

Expectations are on the rise for CBTS to be available to the masses in much the same way that human tutoring is available from a variety of sources today. A limiting factor in the widespread use of CBTS is the cost to: author tutoring systems; author/deliver domain-specific instructional content; and assess the effectiveness of CBTS tools and methods. A structural framework to represent knowledge within the CBTS domain would enhance reuse and streamline processes making them easier to author on production line scale, and opening the entry point for CBTS to non-computer scientists.

abstract = {Large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy (namely wind energy and solar PV) may entail new challenges in power systems and more volatility in power prices in liberalized electricity markets. Energy storage can diminish this imbalance, relieving the grid congestion, and promoting distributed generation. The economic implications of grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies are however obscure for the experts, power grid operators, regulators, and power producers. A meticulous techno- economic or cost-benefit analysis of electricity storage systems requires consistent, updated cost data and a holistic cost analysis framework. To this end, this study critically examines the existing literature in the analysis of life cycle costs of utility-scale electricity storage systems, providing an updated database for the cost elements (capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and replacement costs). Moreover, life cycle costs and levelized cost of electricity delivered by electrical energy storage is analyzed, employing Monte Carlo method to consider uncertainties. The examined energy storage technologies include pumped hydropower storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel, electrochemical batteries (e.g. lead–acid, NaS, Li-ion, and Ni–Cd), flow batteries (e.g. vanadium-redox), superconducting magnetic energy storage, supercapacitors, and hydrogen energy storage (power to gas technologies). The results illustrate the economy of different storage systems for three main applications: bulk energy storage, T{\&}D support services, and frequency regulation.},

abstract = {Objective: We report an experiment in which three training approaches are compared with the goal of training adaptive teams. Background: Cross-training is an established method in which team members are trained with the goal of building shared knowledge. Perturbation training is a new method in which team interactions are constrained to pro-vide new coordination experiences during task acquisition. These two approaches, and a more traditional procedural approach, are compared. Method: Assigned to three training conditions were 26 teams. Teams flew nine simulated uninhabited air vehicle missions; three were critical tests of the team's ability to adapt to novel situations. Team perfor-mance, response time to novel events, and shared knowledge were measured. Results: Perturbation-trained teams significantly outperformed teams in the other conditions in two out of three critical test missions. Cross-training resulted in significant increases in shared teamwork knowledge and highest mean performance in one critical test. Procedural training led to the least adaptive teams. Conclusion: Perturbation training allows teams to match coordination variability during training to demands for coordina-tion variability during posttraining performance. Although cross-training has adaptive benefits, it is suggested that process-oriented approaches, such as perturbation training, can lead to more adaptive teams. Application: Perturbation training is amenable to sim-ulation-based training, where perturbations provide interaction experiences that teams can transfer to novel, real-world situations.},

Based on institutional theory, this article considers student satisfaction as indicative of LMS success and proposes a lens of critical success factors (CSF) as a different new approach for exploring LMS effectiveness. Results obtained in a survey of 8425 students and in semi-structured interviews with 40 students point to five critical success factors for increasing student satisfaction with LMS: Content Completeness, Content Currency, Easy to Navigate, Easy to Access and Course Staff Responsiveness. The main contribution of the CSF lens is in guiding institutions of higher education toward informed decision making regarding LMS technology.},

abstract = {Purpose: In today's increasingly technological world, the first impression of an orgnization is often based on a user's judgment of the corporate Web site's trustworthiness. This study investigates whether color as a Web site element can serve as a trustworthiness cue. In addition, the context of these Web sites was taken into account as research indicates that emotions associated with colors might differ between contexts. Method: An experimental study was conducted in which first impressions of trustworthiness of Web sites were measured in relation with the chosen color scheme. More than 200 participants evaluated eight finance, eight legal, and eight medical Web sites on perceived trustworthiness. Each respondent was presented with an identical Web site that only differed on the used color scheme. Four different color schemes (red, blue, green, and black) were put to the test. Result: The findings indicate that when the same Web site is presented using different color schemes, the Web sites are considered to have different levels of trustworthiness. Color has a statistically significant but limited effect, compared with all other reasons people can have to trust a Web site. Overall, the blue color scheme was perceived as most trustworthy and black as least trustworthy. The effect of the context is statistically significant, but very small. Conclusion: The color-trustworthiness relationship has never been demonstrated in the context of Web sites. This study supports the common sense idea with scientific evidence by showing that color matters in a user's judgment of a Web site's trustworthiness. Web site designers can increase the trustworthiness of a Web site by using an appropriate color scheme.},

Yet, the methodology for assessing the learning benefits of collaboration continues to rely on educational tests designed for isolated individuals. Thus, what counts as evidence of learning does not correspond to current best practices for teaching, and it does not reflect what students are ultimately expected to be able to do with their knowledge. The goals of this paper are to give an overview of the research conducted in several fields of work related to collaboration, propose a framework for the assessment of cognitive skills (such as science or math) through collaborative problem-solving tasks, and propose several statistical approaches to model the data collected from collaborative interactions. This research contributes to the knowledge needed to support a new generation of assessments based on collaboration.},

Yet, this learning potential may not be realized unless teams actively process this feedback by stepping back from their team activity, building plans, and ultimately putting them into action. In an experimental study (. N = 212 undergraduate students), we compared the effects of team-level feedback with or without an intervention prompting shared reflection on the feedback (i.e., guided reflexivity) to a no feedback control group on team performance growth. The results showed that only the combination of team performance feedback and guided reflexivity lead to performance change, at the beginning of team activity. These findings suggest that prompting feedback processing at an early stage of collaborative work has the power to help teams benefit from their past experiences and improve performance.},

abstract = {Objective: We conducted an empirical analysis of human teamwork to investigate the ways teammates incorporate coordination behaviors, including verbal and nonverbal cues, into their action planning. Background: In space, military, aviation, and medical industries, teams of people effectively coordinate to perform complex tasks under stress induced by uncertainty, ambiguity, and time pressure. As robots increasingly are intro- duced into these domains, we seek to understand effective human-team coordination to inform natural and effective human-robot coordination. Method: We conducted team- work experiments in which teams of two people performed a complex task, involving ordering, timing, and resource constraints. Half the teams performed under time pres- sure, and half performed without time pressure. We cataloged the coordination behaviors used by each team and analyzed the speed of response and specificity of each coordina- tion behavior. Results: Analysis shows that teammates respond to explicit cues, includ- ing commands meant to control actions, more quickly than implicit cues, which include short verbal and gestural attention getters and status updates. Analysis also shows that nearly all explicit cues and implicit gestural cues were used to refer to one specific action, whereas approximately half of implicit cues did not often refer to one specific action. Conclusion: These results provide insight into how human teams use coordina- tion behaviors in their action planning. For example, implicit cues seem to offer the teammate flexibility on when to perform the indicated action, whereas explicit cues seem to demand immediate response. Application: We discuss how these findings inform the design of more natural and fluid human-robot teaming.},

abstract = {An instructional strategy called Team-Based Learning (TBL) has been implemented by the authors in courses that emphasize fundamental engineering concepts that are core to the discipline. TBL is an alternative to conventional classroom lecture instruction. In a TBL course, students are placed on permanent learning teams and the teams work together, during class time, to apply course concepts and solve discipline-relevant problems called application exercises. The goal of introducing TBL in these engineering courses is to enhance the quality of student learning by incentivizing student engagement with course content and fostering team skills. This is achieved by using application exercises that require student teams to apply critical thinking and decision-making abilities. Students on high performing teams routinely report that their team's success on application exercises is directly attributable to the thorough preparation by individual student team members outside of class, and that the TBL course structure helped them develop and enhance their ability to learn challenging concepts on their own. An important component of TBL course structure is the inclusion of frequent, timely, and varied types of instructional feedback to students. This paper will introduce a taxonomy for instructional feedback and place the feedback mechanisms that are inherent in the TBL course structure within this context. The form and content of instructional feedback used in TBL engineering courses will be examined. This discussion will include suggestions for achieving a balance between the dimensions of feedback to facilitate the professional development of engineering students.},

abstract = {Little is known about how time pressure affects driving behavior. The present questionnaire-based research addresses this gap in the literature. We used roadside assessment, out-of context self-assessment and hetero-assessment approaches. These approaches (1) identify situational factors eliciting time pressure behind the wheel, (2) explore the emotional reactions of time-pressured drivers, and (3) investigate links between time pressure and risky driving. Our results suggest that time constraints, time uncertainty and goal importance are causal factors for time pressure, which is mostly encountered chronically in professional fields requiring driving. Time pressure is associated with negative emotions and stress, though some motorists also appreciate driving under time pressure because doing so potentially heightens feelings of self-efficacy. Time pressure might increase risk taking, but self-reported accidents were not more numerous. This null finding is critically discussed, but it could result from increased driving ability in chronically time pressured drivers and from adequate adjustments of other drivers. Assessments of objective and subjective factors should be integrated in interventions designed to help working people cope with time pressure behind the wheel.},

abstract = {AIM: It is essential to minimize pain and distress during painful procedures in children. This study examined the effect of using non-immersive Virtual Reality (VR) during a needle-related procedure on reported pain or distress of children and adolescents in a paediatric oncology unit and surveyed their response to the use of VR-equipment during the procedure. METHOD: Twenty-one children and adolescents were included in an intervention group with non-immersive VR and another 21 children and adolescents in a control group where they underwent either venous punctures or subcutaneous venous port devices. Self-reported pain and distress, heart rate and observational pain scores were collected before, during and after the procedures. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in conjunction with the completed intervention. RESULTS: Self-reported and observed pain and distress scores were low and few significant differences of quantitative data between the groups were found. Two themes emerged in the analysis of the interviews; the VR game should correspond to the child and the medical procedure and children enjoyed the VR game and found that it did distract them during the procedure. CONCLUSION: The interviews showed that non-immersive VR is a positive experience for children undergoing a minor procedure such as venous puncture or a subcutaneous venous port access.},

abstract = {The Pinyin Tutor has been used the past few years at over thirty institutions around the world to teach students to transcribe spoken Chinese phrases into Pinyin. Large amounts of data have been collected from this program on the types of errors students make on this task. We analyze these data to discover what makes this task difficult and use our findings to iteratively improve the tutor. For instance, is a particular set of consonants, vowels, or tones causing the most difficulty? Or perhaps do certain challenges arise in the context in which these sounds are spoken? Since each Pinyin phrase can be broken down into a set of features (for example, consonants, vowel sounds, and tones), we apply machine learning techniques to uncover the most confounding aspects of this task. We then exploit what we learned to construct and maintain an accurate representation of what the student knows for best individual instruction. Our goal is to allow the learner to focus on the aspects of the task on which he or she is having most difficulty, thereby accelerating his or her understanding of spoken Chinese beyond what would be possible without such focused "intelligent" instruction.},

abstract = {Objective: The study examined the adaptability of different types of process control training across changes in task and environmental stress. Background: The literature on training leads us to expect greater flexibility for system-based training, as opposed to procedure-based training. However, the stress literature suggests that knowledge-based strategies (making use of executive control) may be more vulnerable under stress conditions. Method: Two groups were given 6 hr of training on the Cabin Air Management System (CAMS), a complex, multilevel, PC-based process control task, emphasizing either system knowledge or use of procedures. They were then required to carry out the task for 3 hr (with noise during the middle 1 hr) across a range of both familiar and unfamiliar fault scenarios. Results: For the primary control task, the system-trained group performed better, especially for less familiar and complex faults. However, for lower priority tasks requiring executive control, procedure-trained operators performed better and were less impaired by noise. Conclusion: System training was more effective for managing unexpected task events, whereas procedural training was better under noise. The results are interpreted in terms of the rationale for instructing operators in the range of strategies required for effective process skills in complex work environments. Application: Training methodologies for safety critical applications should aim to develop skill in the use of both procedural and system knowledge strategies. Operators should be trained in the most effective deployment of these strategies during unfamiliar task events and environmental stress and given stress exposure training.},

Although no previous studies have utilized naturalistic decision making princi- ples to research traffic incident management, the charac- teristics of the workplace seem ideally suited to it. This study used critical decision method (CDM) interviews and the recognition-primed decision model to analyze decisions made by experienced senior responders at traf- fic incidents. CDM interviews were conducted with offi- cers from three agencies: police, emergency services, and road authority traffic officers. The results revealed useful and novel information about the traffic incident man- agement system, for example, interagency coordination issues. The process identified key decision points at inci- dents as well as countermeasures to the identified issues using decision-centered design. These countermeasures were subsequently validated by subject matter experts.},

abstract = {Prior research suggests that youths' engagement in out-of-school time programs may be a crucial factor linking program participation to positive outcomes during adolescence. Guided by the theoretical concept of flow and by stage-environment fit theory, the present study explored correlates of engagement in youth programs. Engagement was conceptualized as the extent to which youth found the program activities enjoyable, interesting, and challenging. The current study examined how program content, monetary incentives, and youth demographic characteristics were linked to youth engagement among a sample of primarily low-income middle and high school youth attending 30 out-of-school programs (n = 435, 51 {\%} female). Results from multilevel models suggested that program content and staff quality were strongly associated with youth engagement. Youth who reported learning new skills, learning about college, and learning about jobs through activities in the program were more engaged, as were youth who found the staff caring and competent. Results demonstrated that the link between learning content for the future and engagement was stronger for older youth than younger youth. In addition, there was a trend suggesting that providing a monetary incentive was associated negatively with youth engagement. Taken as a whole, these findings have important implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in understanding the characteristics of out-of-school time programs that engage older youth.},

abstract = {The concept of a Net Zero Energy Building (Net ZEB) encompasses two options of supplying renewable energy, which can offset energy use of a building, in particular . on-site or . off-site renewable energy supply. Currently, the on-site options are much more popular than the off-site; however, taking into consideration the limited area of roof and/or fa??ade, primarily in the dense city areas, the Danish weather conditions, the growing interest and number of wind turbine co-ops, the off-site renewable energy supply options could become a meaningful solution for reaching 'zero' energy goal in the Danish context. Therefore, this paper deploys the life cycle cost analysis and takes the private economy perspective to investigate the life cycle cost of different renewable energy supply options, and to identify the cost-optimal combination between energy efficiency and renewable energy generation. The analysis includes five technologies, i.e., two on-site options: (1) photovoltaic, (2) micro combined heat and power, and three off-site options: (1) off-site windmill, (2) share of a windmill farm and (3) purchase of green energy from the 100{\%} renewable utility grid. The results indicate that in case of the on-site renewable supply options, the energy efficiency should be the first priority in order to design a cost-optimal Net ZEB. However, the results are opposite for the off-site renewable supply options, and thus it is more cost-effective to invest in renewable energy technologies than in energy efficiency. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Research, starting with K{\"{o}}hler (1926), has demonstrated a type of group motivation gain, wherein the less capable member of a dyad working conjunctively at a persistence task works harder than comparable individuals. To explore possible boundary conditions of this effect, the current experiment systematically varied the amount and timing of performance feedback group members received. Results showed: (a) continuous feedback of both members' performance was not necessary for producing the effect; (b) the effect was attenuated, but not eliminated by delaying and restricting feedback, such that group members only learned which of them was the less capable worker (but not how long s/he persisted) sometime after the task trial was completed; and (c) the motivation gain was eliminated in the absence of any performance feedback (i.e. when neither worker could tell who quit first nor how long either had persisted). Some implications of these results for currently viable explanations of the K{\"{o}}hler effect are discussed. It is concluded that the effect is likely to result from several distinct processes},

@article{Wedzinga2006,
abstract = {Air Forces are facing difficulties in training pilots effectively for their missions. Due to a reduction of defense budgets, fewer resources can be made available for training. In addition, airspace available for training is limited, especially in Europe, and this is aggravated by the increase in the range of advanced weapon systems. Moreover, only few Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) sites are available for suitable training. Embedded Training (ET) is considered to be a potential solution for these problems. ET for fighter aircraft is a capability installed in an operational fighter to train the pilot while operating the aircraft in a situation it was designed for, but which is not available in everyday life. Thereto, the ET capability generates simulated threats and feeds them into the various avionics systems of the aircraft. This allows pilots to train against a virtual force, or a virtually augmented real force. Benefits of employing ET include cost reduction (fewer real aircraft are needed to act as enemy), use of smaller training airspace (simulated threats may move outside this space), and the potential to train anywhere, at any time. NLR, Dutch Space, and the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) have jointly developed an ET system to demonstrate the feasibility of current technology for implementing an ET capability in fighter aircraft. The system, installed in an RNLAF F-16B, supports training for ground-to-air and (one-versus-two) air-to-air engagements. It consists of two units; one unit executes the ET simulations and provides most of the required interfaces with aircraft systems, while the other unit is dedicated to interfacing with the radar processing chain. The system was evaluated by demonstrating it to a group of pilots and engineers and collecting their expert opinions. It was concluded that embedded training has considerable value for a variety of training objectives related to Beyond Visual Range tactics, and it is expected that embedded training will play an important role in the future mission training of fighter-aircraft pilots. ?? 2005 Elsevier SAS.

@article{Salas2007,
abstract = {eam cognition has been identified as a key component to achieve mission goals in dynamic, team-based, stressful, distributed and multicultural operations. Effective team performance in complex environments requires that team members hold a shared understanding of the task, their equipment, and their teammates. So, many of the simulation-based training (SBT) systems and programs have been designed (partly) to enhance shared/team cognition. However, these simulation systems lack the sufficient robustness in their performance assessment tools or capabilities (if they have any) to allow for a rich and deep understanding of team cognition. Therefore, the purpose of this article is fourfold: 1) to present a brief account of team cognition; 2) to develop the concept of performance diagnosis and present SBT as an approach to the performance diagnosis of team cognition; 3) to present a set of illustrative behavioral markers of team cognition; and 4) to explicate how these elements (performance diagnosis, team cognition, and SBT) can be leveraged to increase training effectiveness through the development of performance profilesa rich, detailed, and informative set of metricsand cognitive and behavioral indicators or illustrative markers of team cognition. Research needs are discussed in terms of realizing the potential of this approach in operational and embedded training contexts.},

abstract = {Purpose Our aim is to catalog how the functional behaviors that leaders engage in should change over time based on the needs of the team – thereby presenting a functional view of team leadership over time. Methodology/approach A critical review of the literature on team leadership, team development, and teams was conducted. This information was critically analyzed and integrated to produce a framework serving to depict how team needs change over time, and based on this, highlight the leadership behaviors which should be most critical at particular points in time. Based on the limited amount of literature that explicitly focused on team leadership over time, a series of propositions which flow from the framework are also put forth. Findings Great strides have been made in understanding team leadership; however, little work was uncovered that directly focused on how leadership dynamics change over time within the context of the team. Leveraging the limited work that existed, we developed a framework (and propositions) that serves to delineate how team leadership functions change over time. In doing so, we have integrated work delineating leadership functions within transition and action phases of team task cycles along with that highlighting how the role of the leader may vary based on team developmental needs. Originality/Value The originality of this chapter lies in its using a functional approach to leadership to argue how the efficacy of particular leadership functions change over time based on team task cycles and development needs. This, in turn, can be used to focus training efforts.},

We have developed two instructional approaches to improve col laboration in such settings by promoting people's to collaborate in a capabilities fruitful way and furthering their understanding of what characterizes good collabora tion. The rationale is that strategies necessary for a good and effective computer-me diated collaboration may be conveyed to people by exposing them to an elaborated worked-out collaboration example (observational learning) or by giving them the op portunity to learn from scripted collaborative problem-solving. An experimental study was conducted that compared learning from observing a worked-out collabora tion example with the learning effects of scripted collaborative the problem-solving, effects of unscripted collaborative and a control condition without problem-solving, a learning phase. The experimental design provided clearly separated phases for the instructional treatments (learning phase) and for applying and testing the acquired skills (application phase). Both observing a worked-out collaboration example and collaborating with a script during the learning phase showed positive effects on pro cess and outcome of the second collaboration in the application phase.},

This theory identifies 3 core team-level constructs (team informity, staff validity, and hierarchical sensitivity) and 3 constructs below the team level that are central to decision-making accuracy in hierar- chical teams with distributed expertise. Two studies are presented to test the proposed theory. A total of 492 college students worked on a computerized command-and-control simulator. Results from these studies are discussed in light of the theory. Similarities and differences in results across the 2 studies are discussed, as are potential modifications of the theory considering the data. Finally, implications of the theory for applied team contexts are elaborated. Much},

abstract = {The research reported in this paper focuses on the hypothesis that an intelligent tutoring system that provides guidance with respect to students' meta-cognitive abilities can help them to become better learners. Our strategy is to extend a Cognitive Tutor (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, {\&} Pelletier, 1995) so that it not only helps students acquire domain-specific skills, but also develop better general help-seeking strategies. In developing the Help Tutor, we used the same Cognitive Tutor technology at the meta- cognitive level that has been proven to be very effective at the cognitive level. A key challenge is to develop a model of how students should use a Cognitive Tutor's help facilities. We created a preliminary model, implemented by 57 production rules that capture both effective and ineffective help-seeking behavior. As a first test of the model's efficacy, we used it off-line to evaluate students' help-seeking behavior in an existing data set of student-tutor interactions. We then refined the model based on the results of this analysis. Finally, we conducted a pilot study with the Help Tutor involving four students. During one session, we saw a statistically significant reduction in students' meta-cognitive error rate, as determined by the Help Tutor's model. These preliminary results inspire confidence as we gear up for a larger-scale controlled experiment to evaluate whether tutoring on help seeking has a positive effect on students' learning outcomes.},

abstract = {Researchers have suggested that attention is a key moderating variable predicting performance with an input device [e.g., Greenstein {\&} Arnaut, 1988] without directly assessing the attention demands of devices We hypothesized that the attentional demands of input devices would be intricately linked to whether the device matched the input requirements of the on-screen task. Further, matching task and device should be more important for attentionally reduced groups, such as older adults. Younger and older adults used either a direct (touch screen) or indirect (rotary encoder) input device to perform matched or mismatched input tasks under a spectrum of attention allocation conditions. Input devices required attention - more so for older adults, especially in a mismatch situation. In addition, task performance was influenced by the mach between task demands and input device characteristics. Though both groups benefited from a match between input device and task input requirements, older adults benefited more and this benefit increased as less attention was available. We offer an a priori method to choose an input device for a task by considering the overlap between device attributes and input requirements. These data have implications for design decisions concerning input device selection across age groups and task contexts.},

abstract = {Abstract: There have been a variety of research approaches that have examined the stress issues related to human computer interaction including laboratory studies, cross-sectional surveys, longitudinal case studies and intervention studies. A critical review of these studies indicates that there are important physiological, biochemical, somatic and psychological indicators of stress that are related to work activities where human computer interaction occurs. Many of the stressors of human computer interaction at work are similar to those stressors that have historically been observed in other automated jobs. These include high workload, high work pressure, diminished job control, inadequate employee training to use new technology, monotonous tasks, poor supervisory relations, and fear for job security. New stressors have emerged that can be tied primarily to human computer interaction. These include technology breakdowns, technology slowdowns, and electronic performance monitoring. The effects of the stress of human computer interaction in the workplace are increased physiological arousal; somatic complaints, especially of the musculoskeletal system; mood disturbances, particularly anxiety, fear and anger; and diminished quality of working life, such as reduced job satisfaction. Interventions to reduce the stress of computer technology have included improved technology implementation approaches and increased employee participation in implementation. Recommendations for ways to reduce the stress of human computer interaction at work are presented. These include proper ergonomic conditions, increased organizational support, improved job content, proper workload to decrease work pressure, and enhanced opportunities for social support. A model approach to the design of human computer interaction at work that focuses on the system "balance" is proposed.},

Although empirical studies of team adaptive performance have generated key inferences about team adaptation in specific contexts, there are important conceptual differences across the adaptive stimuli examined in the literature (e.g., novel environments vs. downsizing). We extend theories of team adaptation by suggesting that the effectiveness of team processes and emergent states in driving team adaptive performance will vary based on the nature of the adaptive stimulus. We integrate and extend the team adaptation literature using an IMOI framework to empirically examine a process model of team adaptive performance and examine two distinct contextual moderators: (a) internal versus external changes (i.e., origin), and (b) temporary versus sustained changes (i.e., duration). We meta-analytically examine the processes, emergent states, and inputs that lead to effective team adaptation in general, and in specific contexts. The results of our meta-analysis generally support our proposed model. We discuss implications and directions for future theory and research.},

abstract = {In the linear mixed model (LMM), several R2statistics have been proposed for assessing the goodness-of-fit of fixed effects. However, the performance of these statistics has not been fully demonstrated either analytically or through simulations. We report results of simulations to asses the ability of these statistics to select the most parsimonious model. R2statistics from a full model were compared to other models in which fixed-effect covariates were removed. The full model was also compared to an overfitted model that included additional covariates not linked to the outcome. All models compared involved the same random effects. In this paper, we show that R2statistics that involve the residuals are unable to adequately discriminate between the correct model and one from which important fixed-effect covariates are omitted if the computation of the predicted values for the residuals included the random effects (referred to as conditional R2statistics). However, if the random effects are excluded from the computation of the predicted values that lead to the residuals, these R2statistics (referred to as marginal R2statistics) are able to select the most parsimonious model. Other R2statistics that have been proposed by Xu [2003. Measuring explained variation in linear mixed effects models. Statist.

abstract = {A common measure of the quality or effectiveness of a virtual environment (VE) is the amount of presence it evokes in users. Presence is often defined as the sense of being there in a VE. There has been much debate about the best way to measure presence, and presence researchers need, and have sought, a measure that is reliable, valid, sensitive, and objective. We hypothesized that to the degree that a VE seems real, it would evoke physiological responses similar to those evoked by the corresponding real environment, and that greater presence would evoke a greater response. To examine this, we conducted three experiments, the results of which support the use of physiological reaction as a reliable, valid, sensitive, and objective presence measure. The experiments compared participants' physiological reactions to a non-threatening virtual room and their reactions to a stressful virtual height situation. We found that change in heart rate satisfied our requirements for a measure of presence, change in skin conductance did to a lesser extent, and that change in skin temperature did not. Moreover, the results showed that inclusion of a passive haptic element in the VE significantly increased presence and that for presence evoked: 30FPS {\textgreater} 20FPS {\textgreater} 15FPS},

abstract = {The number of virtual teams is increasing in today's workplaces. In virtual teams, the members can have different cultural backgrounds, they often work in different countries and are professionals in their own fields. In addition, as such diverse and dispersed teams communicate mainly through communication technology this raises the challenge for the team leader of how to unify the team and get the members to identify themselves with the team. This qualitative study focuses on four virtual team leaders and their attempts to strengthen the team members' identification with the team through computer-mediated communication. The results show four different tactics employed in enhancing identification with the team: catering for the individual, giving positive feedback, bringing out common goals and workings and talking up the team activities and face-to-face meetings. The roles of organizational change and technology in identification with virtual teams are also discussed.},

Filling this gap, we build upon Chen and Kanfer's (2006) multilevel theoretical model of motivation in teams, to advance and test a cross-level model of relationships between individual and team motivation and performance. Data from two samples of undergraduates performing simulated team tasks supported the direct and mediated cross-level relationships between team-level prior performance, efficacy, and action processes with individual-level self-efficacy, goal striv- ing, and performance. The findings provide support for a multilevel, system-based formulation of moti- vation and performance in teams. Findings also contribute to the on-going debate on whether motivational processes account for performance once controlling for prior performance},

@phdthesis{Gong2014,
abstract = {After decades of development, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have become a common learning environment for learners of various domains and academic levels. ITSs are computer systems designed to provide instruction and immediate feedback without requiring the intervention of human instructors. All ITSs share the same goal: to provide tutorial services that support learning. Since learning is a very complex process, it is not surprising that a range of technologies and methodologies from different fields is employed. Student modeling is a pivotal technique used in ITSs. The model observes student behaviors in the tutor and creates a quantitative representation of student properties of interest necessary to customize instruction, to respond effectively, to engage students' interest and to promote learning. In this dissertation work, I focus on the following aspects of student modeling. Part I: Student Knowledge: Parameter Interpretation. Student modeling is widely used to obtain scientific insights about how people learn. Student models typically produce semantically meaningful parameter estimates, such as how quickly students learn a skill on average. Therefore, parameter estimates being interpretable and plausible is fundamental. My work includes automatically generating data-suggested Dirichlet priors for the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model, in order to obtain more plausible parameter estimates. I also proposed, implemented, and evaluated an approach to generate multiple Dirichlet priors to improve parameter plausibility, accommodating the assumption that there are subsets of skills which students learn similarly. Part II: Student Performance: Student Performance Prediction. Accurately predicting student performance is one of the common evaluations for student modeling. The task, however, is very challenging, particularly in predicting a student's response on an individual problem in the tutor. I analyzed the components of two common student models to determine which aspects provide predictive power in classifying student performance. I found that modeling the student's overall knowledge led to improved predictive accuracy. I also presented an approach which, rather than assuming students are drawn from a single distribution, modeled multiple distributions of student performances to improve the model's accuracy. Part III: Wheel-spinning: Student Future Failure in Mastery Learning. One drawback of the mastery learning framework is its possibility to leave a student stuck attempting to learn a skill he is unable to master. We refer to this phenomenon of students being given practice with no improvement as wheel-spinning. I analyzed student wheel-spinning across different tutoring systems and estimated the scope of the problem. To investigate the negative consequences of wheel-spinning, I investigated the relationships between wheel-spinning and two other constructs of interest about students: efficiency of learning and “gaming the system”. In addition, I designed a generic model of wheel-spinning, which uses features easily obtained by most ITSs. The model can be well generalized to unknown students with high accuracy classifying mastery and wheel- spinning problems. When used as a detector, the model can detect wheel-spinning in its early stage with satisfactory precision and recall.},

This article describes a performance-based measure of executive function, the Multiple Errands Test-Revised (MET-R), and examines its ability to discriminate between people with mild cerebrovascular accident (mCVA) and control participants. METHOD. We compared the MET-R scores and measures of CVA outcome of 25 participants 6 mo post-mCVA and 21 matched control participants. RESULTS. Participants with mCVA showed no to minimal impairment on measures of executive function at hospital discharge but reported difficulty with community integration at 6 mo. The MET-R discriminated between participants with and without mCVA (p ≤ .002). CONCLUSION. The MET-R is a valid and reliable measure of executive functions appropriate for the evaluation of clients with mild executive function deficits who need occupational therapy to fully participate in community living.},

abstract = {Many organizations are forming “virtual teams” of geographically distributed knowl- edge workers to collaborate on a variety of workplace tasks. But how effective are these virtual teams compared to traditional face-to-face groups? Do they create similar team- work and is information exchanged as effectively? An exploratory study of a World Wide Web-based asynchronous computer conference system known as MeetingWebTM is presented and discussed. It was found that teams using this computer-mediated com- munication system (CMCS) could not outperform traditional (face-to-face) teams under otherwise comparable circumstances. Further, relational links among team members were found to be a significant contributor to the effectiveness of information exchange. Though virtual and face-to-face teams exhibit similar levels of communication effec- tiveness, face-to-face team members report higher levels of satisfaction. Therefore, the paper presents steps that can be taken to improve the interaction experience of virtual teams. Finally, guidelines for creating and managing virtual teams are suggested, based on the findings of this research and other authoritative sources.},

This turbine concept is expected to remain as the major provider of wind power in the foreseeable future. However, turbine sizes are increasing, and installation offshore means that wind turbines will be exposed to more demanding environmental conditions. Many challenges are posed by the use of fiber composites in increasingly large blades and increasingly hostile environments. Among these are achieving adequate stiffness to prevent excessive blade deflection, preventing buckling failure, ensuring adequate fatigue life under variable wind loading combined with gravitational loading, and minimizing the occurrence and consequences of production defects. A major challenge is to develop cost-effective ways to ensure that production defects do not cause unacceptable reductions in equipment strength and lifetime, given that inspection of large wind power structures is often problematic.},

abstract = {More than ever, business practitioners perceive feedback as a vital tool for increasing sustainable business competitiveness; however, research on feedback shows mixed results in terms of its effectiveness. Three problems underlie the paradox of feedback. First, the word ‘feedback' lacks definition. Both scholars and practitioners have different understandings of what feedback means. This lack of clarity hampers successful implementation of feedback as a corporate reflex. Second, feedback can be destructive. In fact, toxic feedback might disengage employees from their jobs. Third, giving and receiving feedback is more difficult than we sometimes like to think. The mantra “our organization has an open feedback culture” does not alone suffice to support effective feedback behavior. This Executive Digest addresses these issues and introduces the feedback ecosystem: a four-step process (receive, reflect, plan, act) bridging theory and practice to anchor effective feedback within organizations. In addition, evidence-based advice is offered on how to implement each step of the feedback ecosystem.},

abstract = {This study investigates whether a tutorial for software training can be enhanced by adding a pedagogical agent, and whether the type of agent matters (i.e., cognitive, motivational, or mixed). The cognitive agent was designed to stimulate students to process their experiences actively. The motivational agent was designed to increase perceived task relevance and self-efficacy beliefs. A mixed agent combined these features. Process and product data were recorded during and after software training of students from the upper grades of vocational education (M age = 16.2 years). Comparison of scores on performance measures during training revealed a significant advantage of working with the motivational and mixed agents for two important motivational mediators for learning (i.e., strategy systematicity and mood). All students were highly successful during training, improving from an average 30{\%} task completion score on the pretest to a 77{\%} posttest score. On a retention measure 3 weeks later, task completion was still at 66{\%}. Working with the motivational and control agents yielded significantly higher retention scores, whereas working with the motivational and mixed agents led to significantly higher scores on task relevance and self-efficacy beliefs after training. The discussion reflects on the possibilities for improving the internal and external properties of the agents. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to the social bases of cognition, taking into consideration how social processes in groups and teams affect performance. This article investigates when and how teams in collaborative learning environments engage in building and maintaining mutually shared cognition, leading to increased perceived performance. In doing so, this research looks for discourse practices managing the co-construction of mutually shared cognition and reveals conditions in the interpersonal context that contribute to engagement in these knowledge-building practices. A comprehensive theoretical framework was developed and tested. The constructs in the model were measured with the Team Learning Beliefs {\&} Behaviors Questionnaire and analyzed using regression and path analysis methodology. Results showed that both interpersonal and sociocognitive processes have to be taken into account to understand the formation of mutually shared cognition, resulting in higher perceived team performance.},

abstract = {Externally observing the experience of a participant in a virtual environment is generally accomplished by viewing an egocentric perspective. Monitoring this view can often be difficult for others to watch due to unwanted camera motions that appear unnatural and unmotivated. We present a novel method for reducing the unnaturalness of these camera motions by minimizing camera movement while maintaining the context of the participant's observations. For each time-step, we compare the parts of the scene viewed by the virtual participant to the parts of the scene viewed by the camera. Based on the similarity of these two viewpoints we next determine how the camera should be adjusted. We present two means of adjustment, one which continuously adjusts the camera and a second which attempts to stop camera movement when possible. Empirical evaluation shows that our method can produce paths that have substantially shorter travel distances, are easier to watch and maintain the original observations of the participant's virtual experience.},

abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems are quite difficult and time intensive to develop. In this paper, we describe a method and set of software tools that ease the process of cognitive task analysis and tutor development by allowing the author to demonstrate, instead of programming, the behavior of an intelligent tutor. We focus on the subset of our tools that allow authors to create ” Pseudo Tutors” that exhibit the behavior of intelligent tutors without requiring AI programming. Authors build user interfaces by direct manipulation and then use a Behavior Recorder tool to demonstrate alternative correct and incorrect actions. The resulting behavior graph is annotated with instructional messages and knowledge labels. We present some preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of this approach, both in terms of reduced development time and learning outcome. Pseudo Tutors have now been built for economics, analytic logic, mathematics, and language learning. Our data supports an estimate of about 25:1 ratio of development time to instruction time for Pseudo Tutors, which compares favorably to the 200:1 estimate for Intelligent Tutors, though we acknowledge and discuss limitations of such estimates.},

Similarly, at the group level of analysis, both Agreeableness and Conscientiousness predicted supervisor ratings of work team performance, objective measures of work team accuracy, and work completed.

The crewmember performing each task was identified, and estimates of the sensory, cognitive, and psychomotor workload associated with the tasks were derived. Estimates of the task times were also derived. The mission/task analysis data were used to develop a computer model of workload for UH-60 crewmembers. The model used a bottom-up approach to build mission functions from tasks and mission segments from functions. Decision rules were written to specify the procedure for combining the tasks into functions and the functions into segments. The model permitted an analysis of total workload experienced by each crewmember in the performance of both sequential and concurrent tasks.},

Role ambiguity, contingency uncertainty, tenure within the organization and job involvement were found to predict FSB. The relationships between both role ambiguity and contingency uncertainty and proactive FSB were found to be moderated by an individual's ability to tolerate ambiguity.},

Ninety-six groups of four people, with one leader per group, served as subjects in a 2 × 2 × 2 design. During a case discussion, the experimenter varied the three independent variables and recorded the content of the leader's verbal behavior by means of the Bales category system. It was found that: (a) positive feedback made the leaders more task oriented, whereas negative feedback increased negative social-emotional behavior; (b) the incentive decreased the number of questions asked; and (c) the manner of presenting the feedback (publicly or privately) produced no changes in verbal behavior when analyzed as a main effect, but significant interactions were found.

abstract = {Organizations increasingly operate within dynamic environments that require them to adapt. To respond quickly and effectively to acute or on-going change, many organizations use teams to help them remain competitive. Accordingly, the topic of team adaptation has become more prominent within the broader organizational team literature. Given the wealth of knowledge that has been accumulated, we consider what has been learned to date. However, even with the increased attention to team adaptation within the literature, not all teams are created equal in terms of their capacity for adaptability. Thus, we review factors that serve as antecedents of team adaptation, the process of adaptation, and the resulting adaptive outcomes. Finally, we suggest future directions for research and practice as we introduce a conceptual framework, whereby the focus of a team's adaptation process is impacted by the type and severity of the disruption or trigger that gives rise to the need for adaptation.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is the context in which the decision makers for traffic management centers (TMCs) choose whether to include and/or use automatic incident detection (AID) algorithms. A survey was conducted of TMC professionals in positions to make, influence, or provide input to decisions regarding TMC operational policies as well as decisions regarding priorities for future system enhancements. Analysis of the survey results not only provides an understanding of the reasons behind the limited implementation of AID algorithms but also allows a direct comparison between the conventional incident detection methods and the AID technology on the basis of measured and/or perceived performance. It was observed that 90{\%} of the survey respondents feel that the current methods of incident detection are insufficient either at present (70{\%}) or will be so in the future (20{\%}). This finding alone motivates a need to redouble research efforts aimed at developing robust and accurate automatic detection methods. In this regard, this paper presents promising directions to overcome past AID algorithm deficiencies},

abstract = {Research on virtual teams (VTs) has proliferated in the last decades. However, few clear and consistent theoretical attempts to integrate the literature on VTs in a systemic way have emerged. This paper uses the complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective to integrate the literature on emergent states in VTs. According to this general framework, VT effectiveness depends on the interaction between three levels of dynamics: local, global and contextual. Team cognition, trust, cohesion and conflict are described as states that emerge from the interactions among the VT members and as parts of global dynamics, they impact on VT effectiveness, and in the same time they are influenced by the outcomes of the VT. The insights on this bidirectional causality as well as other benefits of using the CAS framework to improve our understanding of VTs are discussed in the paper. It also provides an overview of artificial simulation models as well as simulation results concerning the emergence of the four states described in the CAS framework and discusses several ways to improve the accuracy of the simulation models using empirical data collected in real VTs.},

This note presents Persona Cases: personas whose characteristics are both grounded in, and traceable to their originating source of empirical data. This approach builds on the premise that sense-making in qualitative data analysis is an argumentative activity, and aligns concepts associated with a Grounded Theory analysis with recent work on arguing the characteristics of personas.

Collaborative learning refers to learning environments in which small groups of people work together to achieve a common goal, and problem solving is using cognitive processing to find a solution to a problem. Thus, collaborative problem solving is defined as problem solving activities that involve interactions among a group of individuals. This paper will address several key issues (e.g. theory and measurement of collaborative problem solving and issues in measuring problem solving processes). We rely on computerisation of the administration, scoring and reporting of collaborative problem solving skills, thus potentially increasing reliability and validity. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

These problems often lead to increased errors, user dissatisfaction, and often user abandonment. Although there are a plethora of design principles, programs are still being constructed without integration of these principles. One family history-tracking program was examined for usability compliance. In addition to a user analysis, a task analysis was conducted comparing the designers' conceptualization of tasks with the users' conceptualization of these tasks. A cognitive walk-through was then conducted on these tasks. Finally, a keystroke level model was used to show the differences between the execution times of these tasks. This model showed a serious mismatch between the designers and users conceptions of the task. The suggested redesign showed timesaving for each of these tasks.},

abstract = {We conducted a laboratory study on 65 teams performing a decision-making task.The two experimental manipulations involved the use of different communication media and decision frames. The decision frame manipulation involved informing the team to choose the demonstrably correct solution versus the solution that seemed most likely. These factors interacted to reveal novel insights about theirmultiplicative effects on decision processes and team psychological states. Further, main effects of the communication medium were found for team psychological states and decision behavior. Results suggest that virtual teams were at a disadvantage when the task was framed as having a demonstrably correct solution. Conversely, face-to-face teams were more effective, particularly when told that the task had a demonstrably correct solution. Face-to-face teams were more effective on all decision behaviors. Media synchronicity theory serves as a unifying framework to contextualize this research in the literature.},

abstract = {Large software applications are made up of many specialized tools. In Microsoft Word the document editor is supported by tools to create and fix drawings and tables. Programming environments have custom views (difference editors) and analyses (performance reports) to help developers make robust code. Every application has tools to help users sift the documentation. In usability, we usually test a tool at a time, yet complex work requires many tools, and this brings a new set of issues. How do I know when I should be using a different tool? What tool do I need when the one I am using is not working? How do I get to it? How quickly can I start using it? In complex or creative work, our observations show that users seldom choose the correct tool as soon as work progress dictates. This erodes productivity and creativity and is a prime target for improved designs. Usability practice needs a procedure to identify, record, count, and highlight tool switch events for study. This paper describes one that supports the trained observers on which User-Centered Design relies to detect problems and causes, and evaluate design changes.},

@article{Mulvaney2013,
abstract = {Benton County, in north-central Indiana, USA has successfully sited more than 500 turbines. To understand Benton County's acceptance of wind farms, a holistic case study was conducted that included a document review, a survey of local residents and interviews with key stakeholders. Survey questionnaires were sent to 750 residents asking questions about attitudes toward the wind farms, perceived benefits and impacts from the wind farms, environmental attitudes, and demographic information. Key stakeholders were also interviewed for a deeper understanding of the historical timeline and community acceptance of the wind farm development. While there is limited opposition to the turbines, on the whole the community presents a front of acceptance. Financial, rather than environmental, benefits are the main reason for the acceptance. Although significant in other case studies, transparency and participation do not play a large role in Benton County's acceptance. Most residents are not concerned with either visual impacts or noise from the wind turbines. More concrete benefits to the community, such as reduced energy bills for county residents, could help to extend acceptance even further within the community. Although there are concerns about the acceptance of wind farms and the impacts of those farms on local residents in both peer-reviewed literature and popular media, we found little evidence of those concerns in Benton County. Instead, we found Benton County to be a community largely accepting of wind farms.},

@article{Zografos2002,
abstract = {Incident-related congestion is a serious problem of great concern for most metropolitan traffic management authorities. The high economic and social impact associated with the incident-related congestion has prompted Traffic Management Agencies world-wide to develop incident management systems (IMS). Incident response logistics (IRL) encompass all actions needed for the effective deployment of incident response resources and constitute an essential component of any IMS. The incident management decision making environment suggests that decision support systems (DSSs) can be used in order to improve the quality of the decisions and expedite the decision making process of the IRL. The objective of this paper is to develop a DSS for supporting real-time decisions related to IRL. The development of the proposed DSS is based on an extensive user-requirements survey in six European countries and integrates mathematical models, rules and algorithms in a user friendly environment in order to minimise incident response time. The proposed DSS provides the following functionalities: (i) districting, (ii) dispatching of response units (RUs), (iii) routing of the RUs, and (iv) on-scene management and it has been demonstrated successfully under real life conditions and accepted as a useful decision making tool by its users. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to explore possible differences in student performance in humanto-agent (H-A), compared to human-to-human (H-H) CPS assessment tasks. One hundred seventy nine 14 years-old students from the United States, Singapore and Israel participated in the study. Students in both H-H and H-A modes were able to collaborate and communicate by using identical methods and resources. However, while in the H-A mode, students collaborated with a simulated computer-driven partner, and in the H-H mode students collaborated with another student to solve a problem. Overall, the findings showed that CPS with a computer agent involved significantly higher levels of shared understanding, progress monitoring, and feedback. However, no significant difference was found in a student's ability to solve the problem or in student motivation with a computer agent or a human partner. One major implication of CPS score difference in collaboration measures between the two modes is that in H-A mode one can program a wider range of interaction possibilities than would be available with a human partner. Thus, H-A approach offers more opportunities for students to demonstrate their CPS skills. This study is among the first of its kind to investigate systematically the effect of collaborative problem solving in standardized assessment settings.},

As part of this work, we are developing a flexible, scalable, military-based set of collaborative team tasks that can serve as a “testbed” to exercise various aspects of a team ITS architecture. Warfighting teams are a core part of any operation as individual soldiers combine their skill sets and plan, coordinate and act as one entity to accomplish assigned objectives. The team ITS test bed presented in this paper uses simple team tasks to train soldiers on basic functions including observation, target detection, target identification, communication within the team and decision making under stress. The testbed allows for manipulation of various dimensions of tutor feedback, learner work-load, and team size. The testbed enables researchers to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of different types of feedback on militarily-relevant training tasks.},

abstract = {This study sought to unify the team composition literature by using meta-analytic techniques to estimate the relationships between specified deep-level team composition variables (i.e., personality factors, values, abilities) and team performance. The strength of the team composition variable and team performance relationships was moderated by the study setting (lab or field) and the operationalization of the team composition variable. In lab settings, team minimum and maximum general mental ability and team mean emotional intelligence were related to team performance. Only negligible effects were observed in lab settings for the personality factor and team performance relationships, as well as the value and team performance relationships. In contrast, team minimum agreeableness and team mean conscientiousness, openness to experience, collectivism, and preference for teamwork emerged as strong predictors of team performance in field studies. Results can be used to effectively compose teams in organizations and guide future team composition research.},

abstract = {Previous research asserts that teams working in routine situations pass through performance episodes characterized by action and transition phases, while other evidence suggests that certain team behaviors significantly influence team effectiveness during nonroutine situations. We integrate these two areas of research—one focusing on the temporal nature of team episodic performance and the other on interaction patterns and planning in teams—to more fully understand how teams working in dynamic settings successfully transition across routine and nonroutine situations. Using behavioral data collected from airline flight crews working in a flight simulator, we find that different interaction pattern characteristics are related to team performance in routine and nonroutine situations, and that teams engage in more contingency, in-process planning behavior during routine versus nonroutine situations. Moreover, we find that the relationship between this in-process planning and subsequent team adaptiveness is curvilinear (inverted U-shaped). That is, team contingency or in-process planning activity may initially increase team adaptiveness, but too much planning has adverse effects on subsequent performance.},

abstract = {Past research suggests that autonomy has highly variable effects on team performance, and that one explanation for this pattern of findings is that autonomous teams fall into a state of disorder where they lack clarity regarding the goals of the broader organization. Following this perspective, the authors develop a model proposing that performance feedback coupled with high autonomy enables teams to have greater clarity of the organization's goals, which in turn increases team performance. This model was tested on 110 teams in a defense industry manufacturing firm in South Korea using mediated-moderation techniques. Results indicate that highly autonomous teams that receive a high degree of performance feedback outperform other teams because of their heightened level of organizational goal clarity. In contrast, highly autonomous teams that receive low levels of feedback perform at the lowest levels compared to other teams because of a lack of organizational goal clarity. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for theory, research, and practice.},

Second, coordination mediated the relationship between shared mental models and team performance. However, there was some inconsistency in the findings concerning the depth of cross-training necessary for improving shared mental models.

abstract = {High fidelity simulation has become a popular technique for training teamwork skills in high risk industries such as aviation, health care, and nuclear power production. Simulation is a powerful training tool because it allows the trainer to systematically control the schedule of practice, presentation of feedback, and introduction (or suppression) of environmental distractions within a safe, controlled learning environment. Unfortunately, many within the training community have begun to use the terms simulation and high fidelity simulation almost synonymously. This is unfortunate because doing so overemphasises the instructional technology to the detriment of more substantive issues, such as the training's goals, content, and design. It also perpetuates several myths: simulation fidelity is unidimensional, or higher levels of simulation fidelity lead to increased training effectiveness. The authors propose a typology of simulation fidelity and provide examples of how the different classes of simulation have been successfully used to train teamwork skills in high risk industries. Guidelines are also provided to maximise the usefulness of simulation for training teamwork skills in health care.},

The tools, which were developed to support teamwork in college classes, allow instructors to easily collect, interpret, and share data about students and teams. We show how colleges that use the CATME system in all courses requiring teamwork could analyze the data to demonstrate that their programs develop students' team skills. The appendix provides 13 examples of learning goals colleges could use, along with a method to demonstrate achievement for each, and a sample measurable program target. These examples relate to team skills such as working with teammates of diverse backgrounds, contributing effectively to teams, displaying good interpersonal skills, being able to evaluate teamwork, and recognizing team processes and outcomes.},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the implications of usability and learnability in learning management systems (LMS) by considering the experiences of information and communications technology (ICT) experts and non-experts in using the LMS of an open-distance university. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses task-based usability testing augmented by eye tracking, post-test questionnaires and interviews; and data captured by video recordings, eye tracking, post-test questionnaires and interviews. Findings Usability is critical in LMS where students ICT skills vary. The learnability of the LMS was high and providing assistance for first-time users to get past the critical errors, rather than redesigning systems to accommodate low ICT skills, should be considered. Designing an LMS for novices may lead to a less efficient design for regular users. Research limitations/implications Usability testing is limited to the LMS of one open-distance university. ICT skills are identified as a determinant of LMS usability. Practical implications This paper highlights the effect of ICT skills on the usability of LMSs and eventually learning. ICT skills may be an important factor in inhibiting the learning of students from developing communities. If ICT literacy is not recognised and dealt with, the lack of ICT skills may undermine the efforts to use e-learning in bridging the digital divide. Originality/value The effect of ICT skills on the usability of LMSs has not been researched in the context of distance education.},

During working with computers, multiple tasks, perhaps involving multiple documents, are switched. This paper presents the Docking Window Framework: an extended multi-window system supporting such multitasking situations. It enables construction of workspaces comprising multiple windows with simple switching of workspaces. Although previous systems emphasized the support of task-switching after workspace construction, the proposed system characteristically supports construction of workspaces through a docking user interface. It also supports operation of multiple windows simultaneously, provides a tile layout of windows to reduce the overhead of window operations, and supports saving and restoration of workspaces. We conducted two experiments to evaluate the system. In window arrangement tasks, participants performed tasks faster using the proposed system than when using a popular window system (Windows XP). Moreover, in task-switching tasks, participants using our system performed multiple tasks in parallel more efficiently.},

abstract = {This study examines how group attitudes and outcomes evolve over time with repeated use of a group support system. Social Information Processing (SIP) theory, which suggests that relational intimacy may take longer to develop in computer-supported groups, was used as the basis for testing a temporally bounded model of group behavior. The basic argument underlying this model is that computer-sup- ported groups, given adequate time, will exchange enough social information to devel- op strong relational links. Thus, while comput- er support was expected to limit group interac- tions initially, the model predicted that, over a period of time, such constraints would dissi- pate. The results show evidence of such shifts among computer-supported groups. Attitudes of GSS users changed over time from highly negative to somewhat positive; outcomes improved more slowly. The turnaround in atti- tudes of users-toward each other and the interaction process-support the SIP perspec- tive that repeated use of computer support - despite some inherent initial restrictions-can help groups affiliate},

abstract = {This paper discusses factors that may contribute to the participant's sense of presence in immersive virtual environments. We distinguish between external factors, that is those wholly determined by the hardware and software technology employed to generate the environment, and subjective factors, that is how sensory inputs to the human participant are processed internally. The therapeutic technique known as neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is used as a basis for measuring such internal factors. NLP uses the idea of representation systems (visual, auditory and kinesthetic) and perceptual position (egocentric or exocentric) to code subjective experience. The paper also considers one external factor, that is how the virtual environment represents a participant - either as a complete body, or just an arrow cursor that responds to hand-movements. A case- control pilot experiment is described, where the controls have self-representation as an arrow cursor, and the experimental group subjects as a simple virtual body. Measurements of subjects' preferred representation systems and perceptual positions are obtained based on counts of types of predicates and references used in essays written after the experiment. These, together with the control variable (possession/absence of a virtual body) are used as explanatory variables in a regression analysis, with reported sense of presence as the dependent variable. Although tentative and exploratory in nature, the data analysis does suggest a relationship between reported sense of presence, preferred representation system, perceptual position, and an interaction effect between these and the virtual body factor.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new optimization technique for keyboard layouts based on Pareto front optimization. We used this multifactorial technique to create two new touchscreen phone keyboard layouts based on three design metrics: minimizing finger travel distance in order to maximize text entry speed, a new metric to maximize the quality of spell correction by reducing tap ambiguity, and maximizing familiarity through a similarity function with the standard Qwerty layout. The paper describes the optimization process and resulting layouts for a standard trapezoid shaped keyboard and a more rectangular layout. Fitts' law modelling shows a predicted 11{\%} improvement in entry speed without taking into account the significantly improved error correction potential and the subsequent effect on speed. In initial user tests typing speed dropped from approx. 21 wpm with Qwerty to 13 wpm (64{\%}) on first use of our layout but recovered to 18 wpm (85{\%}) within four short trial sessions, and was still improving. NASA TLX forms showed no significant difference on load between Qwerty and our new layout use in the fourth session. Together we believe this shows the new layouts are faster and can be quickly adopted by users.},

Results from a study of 51 four-person teams performing a computerized decision-making task show that decision accuracy was highest when both the leader and staff (denned conjunctively) were high on g and conscientiousness. Post hoc analyses suggest reactions to the weakest member differed depending on whether the member was low in g or conscientiousness. Low-g members were helped, whereas low-conscientiousness members were ignored.},

abstract = {Team coordination consists of both the dynamics of team member interaction and the environmental dynamics to which a team is subjected. Focusing on dynamics, an approach is developed that contrasts with traditional aggregate-static concepts of team coordination as characterized by the shared mental model approach. A team coordination order parameter was developed to capture momentary fluctuations in coordination. Team coordination was observed in three-person uninhabited air vehicle teams across two experimental sessions. The dynamics of the order parameter were observed under changes of a team familiarity control parameter. Team members returned for the second session to either the same (Intact) or different (Mixed) team. “Roadblock” perturbations, or novel changes in the task environment, were introduced in order to probe the stability of team coordination. Nonlinear dynamic methods revealed differences that a traditional approach did not: Intact and Mixed team coordination dynamics looked very different; Mixed teams were more stable than Intact teams and explored the space of solutions without the need for correction. Stability was positively correlated with the number of roadblock perturbations that were overcome successfully. The novel and non-intuitive contribution of a dynamical analysis was that Mixed teams, who did not have a long history working together, were more adaptive. Team coordination dynamics carries new implications for traditional problems such as training adaptive teams.},

It is a collection of best papers presented at an international research conference held in Tramelan (Switzerland) in February 2006. While there are ambitious government targets to increase the share of renewable energy in many countries, it is increasingly recognized that social acceptance may be a constraining factor in achieving this target. This is particularly apparent in the case of wind energy, which has become a subject of contested debates in several countries largely due to its visual impact on landscapes. This paper introduces three dimensions of social acceptance, namely socio-political, community and market acceptance. Factors influencing socio-political and community acceptance are increasingly recognized as being important for understanding the apparent contradictions between general public support for renewable energy innovation and the difficult realization of specific projects. The third dimension, market acceptance, has received less attention so far and provides opportunities for further research, particularly from management scholars.},

Impact of feedback on intentions was not mediated by attitudes, emotions, or self-evaluations, suggesting that participants were not motivated to improve their behaviors because they felt badly about themselves.

abstract = {In the United States, there has been substantial recent growth in wind energy generating capacity, with growth averaging 24 percent annually during the past five years. About 1700MW of wind energy capacity was installed in 2001, while another 410MW became operational in 2002. During 2003, development activity has remained strong, with an estimated 1600MW of capacity installed. With this growth, an increasing number of States are experiencing investment in wind energy projects: currently about half of all States host at least one wind power project. This paper explores the key factors at play in the 12 States in which a substantial amount of wind energy capacity has been developed or planned. Some of the factors that are examined include policy drivers, such as Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), Federal and State financial incentives; as well as market drivers, such as consumer demand for green power, natural gas price volatility, and wholesale market rules.},

Teams with extroverted and agreeable members performed better under the coopera- tive structure, whereas teams low on these orientations performed better under the competitive structure. Finally, reward structure had more impact on team members with low performance.},

abstract = {Shallice and Burgess (1991) reported the utility of the Multiple Errands Test (MET) in discriminating executive deficits in three frontal lobe patients with preserved high IQ, who were otherwise unimpaired on tests of executive function. The aim of this study was to ascertain the value of a simplified version of the MET (MET-SV) for use with the range of people more routinely encountered in clinical practice. Main findings were as follows: 1) The test discriminated well between neurological patients and controls, and the group effects remained when the difference in current general cognitive functions (WAIS-R FSIQ) was taken into account. 2) The best predictors of performance in the healthy control group (n = 46) were age and the number of times participants asked for help (with more requests associated with poorer performance). 3) In the neurological group, two clear patterns of failure emerged, with performance either characterized by rule breaking or failure to achieve tasks. These two patterns were associated with different dysexecutive symptoms in everyday life. 4) The patients not only made more errors than controls, but also different ones. A scoring method that took this into account markedly increased test sensitivity. 5) Many patients passed traditional tests of executive frontal lobe function but still failed the MET-SV. This pattern was strongly associated with observed dysexecutive symptoms in everyday life. The results demonstrate the clinical utility of the test, and suggest that there are two common and independent sources of failure on multitasking tests in a general neurological population: memory dysfunction, and initiation problems.},

In addition, collaborative and individual modes of instruction may be better for acquiring different types of knowledge. Collabora- tive Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) provide a platform that may be able to provide both the cognitive and collaborative support that students need. This paper presents a study comparing collaborative and individual methods while receiving instruction on either procedural or conceptual knowledge. The colla- borative groups had the same learning gains as the individual groups in both the procedural and conceptual learning conditions but were able to do so with fewer problems. This work indicates that by embedding collaboration scripts in ITSs, collaborative learning can be an effective instructional method even with young children.},

abstract = {This article develops and tests a structurally based, integrated theory of person-team fit. The theory developed is an extension of structural contingency theory and considers issues of external fit simultaneously with its examination of internal fit at the team level. Results from 80 teams working on an interdependent team task indicate that divisional structures demand high levels of cognitive ability on the part of teammembers. However, the advantages of high cognitive ability in divisional structures are neutralized when there is poor external fit between the structure and the environment. Instead, emotional stability becomes a critical factor among teammembers when a divisional structure is out of alignment with its environment. Individual differences seem to play little or no role in functional structures, regardless of the degree of external fit.},

abstract = {Transfer in terms of skill maintenance and generalization is one of the key challenges in effective training design. Training design for critical military tasks often entails the use of simulations that are high on physical fidelity to minimize skill decrements that impede training transfer. Although this is an effective approach to resolving the transfer problem, it can be costly and inefficient. Moreover, a new wave of advanced training technologies based on a distributed network architecture is emerging. These emerging training technologies will rely on low fidelity synthetic tasks to address the transfer problem. This chapter presents a theoretically based strategy for training research and design that focuses on psychological fidelity--an explicit effort to model underlying psychological constructs and processes responsible for effective performance. Theoretically driven psychological fidelity is essential for enhancing the training to transfer linkage. We argue that a focus on psychological fidelity can leverage the training potential of cost-efficient low fidelity simulations used in distributed training systems, and can enhance the effectiveness of high fidelity simulations as well. The chapter presents the principles of this approach, illustrates their research application, and describes the advantages of explicitly considering psychological fidelity in training research and design.},

abstract = {Adopting a multilevel approach, we examined how team goal orientation may relate to team creativity and individual creativity. We also theorized and examined the bottom- up process linking individual creativity and team creativity. Multisource data were collected from 485 members and their leaders within 100 R{\&}D teams. The results indicated that a team learning goal and team performance approach goal were positively related-whereas a team performance avoidance goal was negatively related- to both team creativity and individual creativity through team information exchange. Furthermore, a trust relationship with a team leader played a moderating role: when the trust was stronger, the indirect positive relationship with team creativity and individual creativity was stronger for the team learning goal but weaker for the team performance approach goal. We also found that average individual creativity within a team was positively related to team creativity (going above and beyond the effect of team information exchange) through a supportive climate for creativity.

abstract = {This qualitative research study identified criteria for clinical teacher quality preferences as perceived by dental students. Third and fourth year dental students at New York University College of Dentistry were given a two question, open-ended survey asking what qualities they liked most and least in a clinical teacher. Responses were collected until data saturation was achieved. A total of 157 respondents provided a total of 995 written comments. Descriptive words within the responses were coded and grouped into key words, according to similar relationships, and further refined into 17 defined categories. Three core themes, Character, Competence and Communication, emerged from these 17 categories, which were validated according to specific references found in the existing educational literature. ‘Character' comprised nine of the 17 defined categories: (caring, motivation, empathy, patience, professionalism, available, fairness, happiness, patient-centred) and yielded 59.1{\%} of total student responses; ‘Competence' consisted of five categories: knowledgeable, expertise, efficient, skilful, effective (29.2{\%}); and ‘Communication' represented the remaining three categories: feedback, approachable and interpersonal communication (11.7{\%}). Positive and negative responses related to the defined category of caring were cited by 59.2{\%} of all students. Motivation was the next highest category, cited by 45.9{\%} of students. Non-cognitive attributes, especially those in the Character theme, comprised the majority of student comments. Because students' perceptions are so critical to understanding clinical teaching effectiveness in dental education, these findings can be used to develop assessments to measure clinical teaching effectiveness, to create criteria for the hiring and promotion of clinical faculty and to plan faculty development programming.},

abstract = {Preparing university graduates for the world of work must address teamness, a quality essential to working in complex and dynamic organizations. Mutual performance monitoring (MPM) highlighted as a fundamental component in the authors' initial team learning theory is examined. It was thought that first year university students may not have the skills of MPM to affect high quality team outputs, and our results suggest this is true. It is proposed that students are supported with strategies which legitimize monitoring the work of their team members and that the ideas of collusion, spying and cheating are replaced with teamness. Further, it appears that many academics are unprepared or ill-equipped to prepare students for a world of work in teams. Exposing the naivety of students, presenting perceived and positive changes in team skills and suggesting strategies may provide some pedagogical guidance for academic educators to better implement team learning.

abstract = {Freeway congestion is a major and costly problem in many U.S. metropolitan areas. From a traveler's perspective, congestion has costs in terms of longer travel times and lost productivity. From the traffic manager's perspective, congestion causes a freeway to operate inefficiently and below capacity. There are also environmental costs associated with congestion such as increased pollution and noise. Researchers have estimated that “non-recurring” congestion due to freeway incidents such as accidents, disabled vehicles, and weather events accounts for one-half to three-fourths of the total congestion on metropolitan freeways in this country. The objective of this study is to develop a forecasting model that can predict the clearance time of a freeway accident. This can aid traffic managers in making decisions regarding the appropriate response to freeway incidents. Three models were investigated in this paper; a stochastic model, nonparametric regression model, and classification tree model. The stochastic model was not applied to forecasting future accidents due to the lack of a probabilistic distribution to fit the clearance time data. The Weibull and lognormal distributions have been applied to incident duration in the past, but were not applicable to the accident clearance time data used in this study. The other two models were developed but suffered from poor performance in predicting the clearance time of future accidents. However, the classification tree model appears to be well suited for forecasting the phases of incident duration given a database of incidents with reliable and informative characteristics.},

The user can explicitly specify a set of possibly overlapping upright rectangles that represent the objects of interest. These full-space rectangles are processed by the system to create a representation of the remaining empty space. This representation makes it easy for users to develop customized spatial allocation strategies that avoid overlapping the full-space rectangles. We describe the representation; provide efficient incremental algorithms for adding and deleting full-space rectangles, and for querying the empty-space representation; and show several allocation strategies that the representation makes possible. We present two testbed applications that incorporate an implementation of the algorithm; one shows the utility of our representation for window management tasks; the other applies it to the layout of components in a 3D user interface, based on the upright 2D bounding boxes of their projections.},

abstract = {Many producers and consumers of legacy training simulator and game environments are beginning to envision a new era where psycho-socio-physiologic models could be interoperated to enhance their environments' simulation of human agents. This paper explores whether we could embed our behavior modeling framework (described in the companion paper, Part 1) behind a legacy first person shooter 3D game environment to recreate portions of the Black Hawk Down scenario. Section I amplifies the interoperability needs and challenges confronting the field, presents the questions that are examined, and describes the test scenario. Sections 2 and 3 review the software and knowledge engineering methodology, respectively, needed to create the system and populate it with bots. Results (Section 4) and discussion (Section 5) reveal that we were able to generate plausible and adaptive recreations of Somalian crowds, militia, women acting as shields, suicide bombers, and more. Also, there are specific lessons learned about ways to advance the field so that such interoperabilities will become more affordable and widespread.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes our efforts to bring together and extend the best in current theory and technologies for teamwork-centered autonomy for space applications. Traditional planning technologies at the foundation of intelligent robotic systems typically take an autonomycentered approach, with representations, mechanisms, and algorithms that have been designed to ingest a set of goals and output a complete plan in the most efficient and sound fashion possible. A teamwork-centered autonomy approach, on the other hand, takes as a beginning premise that people are working in parallel alongside autonomous systems, and hence adopts the stance that the processes of understanding, problem solving, and task execution are necessarily incremental, subject to negotiation, and forever tentative. Thus, a successful approach to teamwork-centered autonomy will require that every element of the autonomous system be designed to facilitate the kind of give-and-take that quintessentially characterizes natural and effective teamwork among groups of people. We briefly describe the major components of this approach and current efforts to apply and evaluate its utility from both human-centered and cost-benefit perspectives.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of simulation-based training for individual tasks -- such as piloting skills -- is well established, but its use for team training raises challenging technical issues. Ideally, human users could gain valuable leadership experience by interacting with synthetic teammates in realistic and potentially stressful scenarios. However, creating human-like teammates that can support flexible, natural interactions with humans and other synthetic agents requires integrating a wide variety of capabilities, including models of teamwork, models of human negotiation, and the ability to participate in face-to-face spoken conversations in virtual worlds. We have developed such virtual humans by integrating and extending prior work in these areas, and we have applied our virtual humans to an example peacekeeping training scenario to guide and evaluate our research. Our models allow agents to reason about authority and responsibility for individual actions in a team task and, as appropriate, to carry out actions, give and accept orders, monitor task execution, and negotiate options. Negotiation is guided by the agents' dynamic assessment of alternative actions given the current scenario conditions, with the aim of guiding the human user towards an ability to make similar assessments.},

The aim of this research is to support human decision making teams using cognitive agents empowered by a collaborative Recognition-Primed Decision model. In this paper, we rst describe an RPD- enabled agent architecture (R-CAST), in which we have implemented an internal mechanism of decision-making adaptation based on collaborative expectancy monitoring, and an information exchange mechanism driven by relevant cue analysis. We have evaluated R-CAST agents in a real-time simulation environment, feeding teams with frequent decision- making tasks under dierent tempo situations. While the result conforms to psychological ndings that human team members are extremely sensitive to their workload in high- tempo situations, it clearly indicates that human teams, when supported by R-CAST agents, can perform better in the sense that they can maintain team performance at ac- ceptable levels in high time pressure situations.},

abstract = {The research reported in this paper focuses on the hypothesis that an intelligent tutoring system that provides guidance with respect to students' meta-cognitive abilities can help them to become better learners. Our strategy is to extend a Cognitive Tutor (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, {\&} Pelletier, 1995) so that it not only helps students acquire domain-specific skills, but also develop better general help-seeking strategies. In developing the Help Tutor, we used the same Cognitive Tutor technology at the meta- cognitive level that has been proven to be very effective at the cognitive level. A key challenge is to develop a model of how students should use a Cognitive Tutor's help facilities. We created a preliminary model, implemented by 57 production rules that capture both effective and ineffective help-seeking behavior. As a first test of the model's efficacy, we used it off-line to evaluate students' help-seeking behavior in an existing data set of student-tutor interactions. We then refined the model based on the results of this analysis. Finally, we conducted a pilot study with the Help Tutor involving four students. During one session, we saw a statistically significant reduction in students' meta-cognitive error rate, as determined by the Help Tutor's model. These preliminary results inspire confidence as we gear up for a larger-scale controlled experiment to evaluate whether tutoring on help seeking has a positive effect on students' learning outcomes.},

In an online experiment, 192 participants performed a speed-reading task. The independent variables included whether or not the verbal feedback from the computer involved praise, whether the objective feedback showed that the participants were performing better or worse from their peers, and whether or not the feedback was presented by an on-screen agent. The main dependent variables included a subjective measure of participants' intrinsic motivation and an objective measure of their task persistence. Results showed that providing participants with praise or comparative information on others' performance improved intrinsic motivation. When praised, participants whose performances were comparatively low persisted in the task longer than those whose performances were comparatively high did. Additionally, the mere presence of an embodied agent on the screen increased participants' motivation. Together, these results indicate that praise and social comparison can serve as effective forms of motivational feedback and that humanlike embodiment further improves user motivation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The success of these robots - whether in motivating users to adhere to a diet regimen or in encouraging them to follow evacuation procedures in the case of a fire - will rely largely on their ability to persuade people. Research in a range of areas from political communication to education suggest that the nonverbal behaviors of a human speaker play a key role in the persuasiveness of the speaker's message and the listeners' compliance with it. In this paper, we explore how a robot might effectively use these behaviors, particularly vocal and bodily cues, to persuade users. In an experiment with 32 participants, we evaluate how manipulations in a robot's use of nonverbal cues affected participants' perceptions of the robot's persuasiveness and their compliance with the robot's suggestions across four conditions: (1) no vocal or bodily cues, (2) vocal cues only, (3) bodily cues only, and (4) vocal and bodily cues. The results showed that participants complied with the robot's suggestions significantly more when it used nonverbal cues than they did when it did not use these cues and that bodily cues were more effective in persuading participants than vocal cues were. Our model of persuasive nonverbal cues and experimental results have direct implications for the design of persuasive behaviors for humanlike robots.},

abstract = {ObjectiveThis article presents a systematic framework characterizing adaptive systems. BackgroundAdaptive systems are those that can appropriately modify their behavior to fit the current context. This concept is appealing because it offers the possibility of creating computer assistants that behave like good human assistants who can provide what is needed without being asked. However, the majority of adaptive systems have been experimental rather than practical because of the technical challenges in accurately perceiving and interpreting users' current cognitive state; integrating cognitive state, environment, and task information; and using it to predict users' current needs. The authors anticipate that recent developments in neurological and physiological sensors to identify users' cognitive state will increase interest in adaptive systems research and practice over the next few years. MethodTo inform future efforts in adaptive sys-tems, this work provides an organizing framework for characterizing adaptive systems, identifying consider-ations and implications, and suggesting future research issues. ResultsA two-part framework is presented that (a) categorizes ways in which adaptive systems can modify their behavior and (b) characterizes trigger mechanisms through which adaptive systems can sense the current situation and decide how to adapt.

abstract = {Researchers and developers are pursuing increasingly sophisticated roles for autonomous systems. Whether working within networked systems as software agents or embedded in robots and unmanned vehicles, what makes these systems valuable is their intelligent, active, and adaptive nature. These qualities are often characterized in intelligent systems literature by the word "autonomy"-a catch-all label that highlights the qualities of self-directedness and self-sufficiency in task performance. Though continuing research to make machines more active, adaptive, and functional is essential, the point of increasing such proficiencies is not merely to make the machines more independent during times when unsupervised activity is desirable or necessary, but also to make them more capable of sophisticated interdependent joint activity with people and other machines when such is required. That means autonomous systems must support not only fluid orchestration of task handoffs among different people and machines, but also combined participation on shared tasks requiring continuous and close interaction. HART research seeks to bring together the best thinking from diverse research communities in order to advance current and anticipated applications of intelligent human-machine collaboration, including the participation of humans as first-class citizens in collaboration with autonomous systems. This would enable autonomous systems not merely to do things for people, but also to work together with people and other systems-the inevitable next leap-forward required in autonomous system design and deployment.},

Decoupling algorithms can enhance or degrade facets of nonverbal behavior within CVEs, such that interactants can reap the benefits of nonverbal enhancement or suffer nonverbal degradation.

The aim of this study was to ascertain the value of a simplified version of the MET (MET-SV) for use with the range of people more routinely encountered in clinical practice. Main findings were as follows: 1) The test discriminated well between neurological patients and controls, and the group effects remained when the difference in current general cognitive functions (WAIS-R FSIQ) was taken into account. 2) The best predictors of performance in the healthy control group (n = 46) were age and the number of times participants asked for help (with more requests associated with poorer performance). 3) In the neurological group, two clear patterns of failure emerged, with performance either characterized by rule breaking or failure to achieve tasks. These two patterns were associated with different dysexecutive symptoms in everyday life. 4) The patients not only made more errors than controls, but also different ones. A scoring method that took this into account markedly increased test sensitivity. 5) Many patients passed traditional tests of executive frontal lobe function but still failed the MET-SV. This pattern was strongly associated with observed dysexecutive symptoms in everyday life. The results demonstrate the clinical utility of the test, and suggest that there are two common and independent sources of failure on multitasking tests in a general neurological population: memory dysfunction, and initiation problems.},

In the experimental condition, social and emotional interactions were used to guide the dialogue between a participant and a virtual robot in order to promote team building. In the matched control condition, the interactions were information-focused, without social or emotional interaction. We show that social interaction moderated the effect of trust on reliance such that higher trust led to greater reliance on the robot.

abstract = {Since the 1960s, the rapid growth of information systems has led to the wide development of research on human-computer interaction (HCI) that aims at the designing of human-computer interfaces presenting ergonomic properties, such as friendliness, usability, transparency, etc. Various work situations have been covered-clerical work, computer programming, design, etc. However, they were mainly static in the sense that the user fully controls the computer. More recently, public and private organizations have engaged themselves in the enterprise of managing more and more complex and coupled systems by the means of automation. Modern machines not only process information, but also act on dynamic situations as humans have done in the past, managing stock exchange, industrial plants, aircraft, etc. These dynamic situations are not fully controlled and are afffected by uncertain factors. Hence, degrees of freedom must be maintained to allow the humans and the machine to adapt to unforeseen contingencies. A human-maching cooperation (HMC) approach is necessary to address the new stakes introduced by this trend. This paper describes the possible improvement of HCI by HMC, the need for a new conception of function allocation between humans and machins, and the main problems encountered within the new forms of human-machine relationship. It proposes a conceptual framework to study HMC from a cognitive point of view in highly dynamic situations like aircraft piloting or air-traffic control, and concludes of the design of 'cooperative' machines.},

(International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 11, 47--78, 2000) introduced and surveyed a new paradigm for interactive learning environments: animated pedagogical agents. The article argued for combining animated interface agent technologies with intelligent learning environments, yielding intelligent systems that can interact with learners in natural, human-like ways to achieve better learning outcomes. We outlined a variety of possible uses for pedagogical agents. But we offered only preliminary evidence that they improve learning, leaving that to future research and development. Twenty years have elapsed since work began on animated pedagogical agents. This article re-examines the concepts and predictions in the 2000 article in the context of the current state of the field. Some of the ideas in the paper have become well established and widely adopted, especially in game-based learning environments. Others are only now being realized, thanks to advances in immersive interfaces and robotics that enable rich face-to-face interaction between learners and agents. Research has confirmed that pedagogical agents can be beneficial, but not equally for all learning problems, applications, and learner populations. Although there is a growing body of research findings about pedagogical agents, many questions remain and much work remains to be done.},

It was implemented within the Virtual Mall (VMall), a novel functional video-capture virtual shopping environment. The main objectives were (1) to examine the relationships between the performance of three groups of participants in the Multiple Errands Test (MET) carried out in a real shopping mall and their performance in the VMET, (2) to assess the relationships between the MET and VMET of the post-stroke participant's level of executive functioning and independence in instrumental activities of daily living, and (3) to compare the performance of post-stroke participants to those of healthy young and older controls in both the MET and VMET. The study population included three groups; post-stroke participants (n = 9), healthy young participants (n = 20), and healthy older participants (n = 20). The VMET was able to differentiate between two age groups of healthy participants and between healthy and post-stroke participants thus demonstrating that it is sensitive to brain injury and ageing and supports construct validity between known groups. In addition, significant correlations were found between the MET and the VMET for both the post-stroke participants and older healthy participants. This provides initial support for the ecological validity of the VMET as an assessment tool of executive functions. However, further psychometric data on temporal stability are needed, namely test-retest reliability and responsiveness, before it is ready for clinical application. Further research using the VMET as an assessment tool within the VMall with larger groups and in additional populations is also recommended.},

abstract = {The ability of social agents, be it virtually-embodied avatars or physically-embodied robots, to display social behavior and interact with their users in a natural way represents an important factor in how effective such agents are during interactions. In particular, endowing the agent with effective communicative abilities, well-suited for the target application or task, can make a significant difference in how users perceive the agent, especially when the agent needs to interact in complex social environments. In this work, we consider how two core input communication modalities present in human-robot interaction—speech recognition and touch-based selection—shape users' perceptions of the agent. We design a short interaction in order to gauge adolescents' reaction to the input communication modality employed by a robot intended as a long-term companion for motivating them to engage in daily physical activity. A study with n = 52 participants shows that adolescents perceive the robot as more of a friend and more socially present in the speech recognition condition than in the touch-based selection one. Our results highlight the advantages of using speech recognition as an input communication modality even when this represents the less robust choice, and the importance of investigating how to best do so.},

In this paper, we draw on techniques from brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and knowledge from educational psychology to design adaptive agents that monitor student attention in real time using measurements from electroencephalography (EEG) and recapture diminishing attention levels using verbal and nonverbal cues. An experimental evaluation of our approach showed that an adaptive robotic agent employing behavioral techniques to regain attention during drops in engagement improved student recall abilities 43{\%} over the baseline regardless of student gender and significantly improved female motivation and rapport. Our findings offer guidelines for developing effective adaptive agents, particularly for educational settings.},

abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems are quite difficult and time intensive to develop. In this paper, we describe a method and set of software tools that ease the process of cognitive task analysis and tutor development by allowing the author to demonstrate, instead of programming, the behavior of an intelligent tutor. We focus on the subset of our tools that allow authors to create ” Pseudo Tutors” that exhibit the behavior of intelligent tutors without requiring AI programming. Authors build user interfaces by direct manipulation and then use a Behavior Recorder tool to demonstrate alternative correct and incorrect actions. The resulting behavior graph is annotated with instructional messages and knowledge labels. We present some preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of this approach, both in terms of reduced development time and learning outcome. Pseudo Tutors have now been built for economics, analytic logic, mathematics, and language learning. Our data supports an estimate of about 25:1 ratio of development time to instruction time for Pseudo Tutors, which compares favorably to the 200:1 estimate for Intelligent Tutors, though we acknowledge and discuss limitations of such estimates.},

We designed a set of gaze behaviors for Robovie to signal three kinds of participant roles: addressee, bystander, and overhearer. We evaluated our design in a controlled laboratory experiment with 72 subjects in 36 trials. In three conditions, the robot signaled to two subjects, only by means of gaze, the roles of (1) two addressees, (2) an addressee and a bystander, or (3) an addressee and an overhearer. Behavioral measures showed that subjects' participation behavior conformed to the roles that the robot communicated to them. In subjective evaluations, significant differences were observed in feelings of groupness between addressees and others and liking between overhearers and others. Participation in the conversation did not affect task performance-measured by recall of information presented by the robot-but affected subjects' ratings of how much they attended to the task.},

abstract = {Modern day teams, whether in the military or civilian workplace, have the ability to achieve goals that are otherwise unobtainable by individuals. The timing and characteristics of feedback that teams receive during training are critical. Though there is a solid foundation of research on optimal feedback, there is limited exploration of what constitutes ideal team feedback including addressing the individual team member versus the whole team and whether that feedback is public (visible to the entire team) or private (visible only to one member of the team). Previous research that studied the effect of feedback on team performance has yielded slightly different conclusions. For example, research focused on the privacy of feedback suggests that public feedback can have a motivational effect that improves performance. The aim of this work is to discover the most effective combination of the target and privacy of feedback. To accomplish this goal a modified version of the Multiple Errands Test (MET) was developed to evaluate the performance of three-member teams, the Team MET (TMET). The MET, normally used for evaluating cognitive processing, requires that specific rules be followed while completing multiple tasks within a time constraint. Participants performed the TMET while coordinating purchases in a virtual mall. In each of four timed shopping sessions, participants received feedback on their performance as an individual and team. Feedback was given in one of four conditions: individual private, team private, individual public, and team public. Task performance and rule errors were measured as dependent variables. Results did not yield a broadly significant effect of feedback condition on team or individual performance. However, the study did demonstrate the validity of the TMET as a platform for assessing a team's ability to perform under heavy cognitive load.},

We analyze these data to discover what makes this task difficult and use our findings to iteratively improve the tutor. For instance, is a particular set of consonants, vowels, or tones causing the most difficulty? Or perhaps do certain challenges arise in the context in which these sounds are spoken? Since each Pinyin phrase can be broken down into a set of features (for example, consonants, vowel sounds, and tones), we apply machine learning techniques to uncover the most confounding aspects of this task. We then exploit what we learned to construct and maintain an accurate representation of what the student knows for best individual instruction. Our goal is to allow the learner to focus on the aspects of the task on which he or she is having most difficulty, thereby accelerating his or her understanding of spoken Chinese beyond what would be possible without such focused "intelligent" instruction.},

abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the perception and sources of stress, coping mechanisms used, and self-esteem in nursing students during 3 years of their undergraduate nursing programme.

METHODS: The sample consisted of a cohort of nursing students going through 3 years of a nursing programme. The method was a descriptive correlational design. The questionnaire consisted of demographic data, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Self-esteem Scale, and the modified Ways of Coping Scale. Data were analysed using frequency distributions, content analysis, and measures of correlation.

RESULTS: Results indicated that students in year 1 experienced significantly less transient stress as compared with year 2; students in year 3 had more positive self-esteem than year 2 students. There were no significant differences with regard to chronic stress, avoidance and proactive coping, and negative self-esteem. Chronic and transient stress, as measured by GHQ, were significantly correlated (P {\textless} 0.01) with avoidance coping behaviours, and negative self-esteem. Positive self-esteem was significantly correlated (P {\textless} 0.01) with proactive coping behaviours. The four main stressors in the last three years for this cohort of students, in descending order are nursing studies, finance, family and health. They coped by using both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping skills. There is a need to review the nursing curriculum and evaluate what impacts on students' stress levels, and also introduce strategies to reduce the stress levels of nursing students.},

abstract = {It is hypothesized that highly effective teams adapt to stressful situations by using effective coordination strategies. Such teams draw on shared mental models of the situation and the task environment as well as mutual mental models of inter- acting team members' tasks and abilities to shift to modes of implicit coordination, and thereby reduce coordination overhead. To test this hypothesis, we developed and implemented a team-training procedure designed to train teams to adapt by shifting from explicit to implicit modes of coordination and choosing strategies that are appropriate during periods of high stress and workload conditions. Results showed that the adaptation training significantly improved performance from pre- to posttraining and when compared with a control group. Results also showed that several underlying team process measures exhibited patterns indicat- ing that adaptive training improved various team processes, including efficient use of mental models, which in turn improved performance. The implication of these findings for team adaptive training is discussed. This research spawned the adaptive architectures for a command and control project investigating adaptive models that focus on changes in the structural and process architecture of large organizations. The research also produced a cadre of integrated performance assessment tools that have been used in training and diagnostic settings, and new components for a team training package focused on effective coordination in high-performance teams.},

METHOD: Thirty novice endoscopists were pretested on a colonoscopy simulator task. Participants then received feedback either during (concurrent) or after (terminal) each of their 12 practice trials. Effectiveness of training was assessed using an immediate posttest and one week later on retention and transfer tests. Measures included execution time and blinded expert assessments. RESULTS: Both groups performed similarly on the pre-, post-, and retention tests. At transfer, the terminal feedback group performed significantly better as measured by execution time, checklist, and global rating scores. The concurrent feedback group's performance decreased significantly on the transfer test as compared with the posttest and retention test. CONCLUSIONS: Not all feedback conditions seem equally effective. The use of terminal feedback resulted in better learning as demonstrated by superior performance during transfer.},

Three experiments using an interleaved tasks interruption paradigm showed that longer and more demanding interruptions led to longer resumption times in a hierarchical, interactive task. The resumption time profile for durations up to 1 min supported the role of decay in defining resumption costs, and the interaction between duration and demand supported the importance of goal rehearsal in mitigating decay. These findings supported the memory for goals model, and had practical implications for context where tasks are frequently interleaved such as office settings, driving, emergency rooms, and aircraft cockpits.},

Pass blocking was measured during practice drills and games, and our intervention included descriptive feedback with and without video feedback and teaching with acoustical guidance (TAG). Intervention components and pass blocking were evaluated in a multiple baseline design, which showed that video feedback and TAG were the most effective procedures. For all players, improved pass blocking matched a standard derived by observing more experienced linemen and was evident in games. Additional intervention was required to maintain pass-blocking proficiency. Issues pertinent to behavioral coaching and sport psychology research are discussed.},

abstract = {Leaders have been argued to play a key role in determining organizational effectiveness across all levels (e.g., individual, team, unit) that exist within organizations. A key component in a leader's ability to be effective within such environments is the degree to which subordinates and co-workers trust him/her. Therefore, it is not surprising that researchers and practitioners alike are interested in identifying the mechanisms through which trust in leadership can be developed as well as those factors which moderate this relationship [e.g., Gillespie, N. A., Mann, L. (2004). Transformational leadership and shared values: The building blocks of trust. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 19, 588–607; Kouzes and Posner, 1995; Roberts, K. H., O'Reilly, C. A. (1974). Failures in upward communication in organizations: Three possible culprits. Academy of Management Journal, 17, 205–215; Whitener, E. M. (1997). The impact of human resource activities on employee trust. Human Resource Management Review, 7, 389–404]. Despite this, research that has addressed the factors that foster trust in leaders and the outcomes of this trust has been disjointed and, as yet, no comprehensive model has been presented to systematically examine these factors. Therefore, the purpose of this article will be to present an integrative model of trust in leadership.},

In particular, froma design viewpoint, it is necessary to be able to move from the extensive observational data that is often collected during a field study to information that is relevant for design. In this paper, we discuss the use of theories and models of human–machine interaction to guide the analysis of information gathered during field studies, and illustrate the application of an artefact-based theory with the results fromtwo different and independently conducted case studies. This approach was valuable in structuring information collected in flexible environments, in which models that rely on the normative procedures found in more causal environments may be less useful. In addition to shaping the interpretation of data fromthe two studies, the use of an artefact-based theory also proved useful in integrating results across the two field studies, to suggest more domain-independent design criteria.},

Earlier, Lavery (1962) showed that, relative to providing KR after each trial, a 20-trial summary KR was detrimental to performance in a practice phase with KR present but was beneficial for a no-KR retention test. Using a relatively simple ballistic-timing task, we examined summary lengths of 1 (essentially KR after every trial), 5, 10, and 15 trials, searching for an inverted-U relationship between summary length and retention performance as predicated by a guidance hypothesis for KR. During acquisition when KR was present and being manipulated, all groups showed improvements in performance across practice, while increased summary lengths generally depressed performance. However, in a delayed no-KR retention test, there was an inverse relation between the summary length in acquisition and absolute constant error on the retention test. A guidance hypothesis is favored to explain how, relative to immediate KR, long KR summaries can provide detrimental effects in acquisition while enhancing retention performance.},

abstract = {Teams with records of superior performance have one common critical characteristic: they are extremely adaptive to varying task demands. These teams were observed to switch between several different coordination strategies and organizational structures, with different lines of authority, communication patterns, and task responsibilities, as they move between normal operations and high-tempo or emergency situations. Two ques- tions are central to the issue: What are the effects of external stressors on team performance, and what are the mechanisms by which teams of decision-makers cope with stress? Our main hypothesis is that team coordination strategies evolve from explicit coordination under low workload conditions to implicit coordination as workload increases. To illustrate these ideas, this paper presents findings Erom an experimental study on the effects of stress on the performance of command teams. The computer-based experimental task simulates operations in a naval environment in which a hierarchical team of four decision-makers must coordinate complex and ambiguous information to make identifications on air targets. Three task-related stressors -time-pressure, uncertainty, and ambiguity-, and one information-structural variable were manipulated in a within-subject, full-factorial design. Results show some complex patterns of the way the different stressors combine to generate stress and affect the team decision and coordination strategies. Implicit coordination patterns, anticipatory behavior, and redirection of the team communication strategy are evident under conditions of increased time-pressure. Discrepancy between the subordinates' and the team leader's mental model of the costs of errors generates non-mvial patterns of error-making in the teams. The team leader's periodic update had a stabilizing effect on the team communica- tion strategy. Different implementations of team training interventions to enhance mutual anticipation, prevent inadequate adaptation to stress, and foster implicit coordination in command teams are proposed},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether students drink more alcohol on higher-stress days than on lower-stress days; whether daily coping strategies and affective states mediate the within-person relationship between stress and drinking; and whether the daily stress-drinking process varies as a function of previously identified between-person risk factors (sex, family history, coping motives, sensation seeking, neuroticism).

METHOD: College students (N = 137) completed daily surveys for 28 consecutive days.

RESULTS: With daily coping, affect and weekly trends in drinking controlled for, students consumed more alcohol on days that had events perceived as relatively more stressful. Students also drank more on days characterized by relatively lower problem-focused coping and relatively higher positive and negative affect. Contrary to predictions, the effect of stress on drinking was not fully mediated by coping and affect. Findings also revealed individual differences in several links in the daily stress coping-drinking process.

CONCLUSIONS: The daily stress coping-drinking process is complex, and it appears that there are both positive and negative affective pathways underlying daily alcohol consumption.},

Performance monitoring is the ability of team members to monitor each other's task execution and give feedback during task execution. Team self-correction is the process in which team members engage in evaluating their performance and in determining their strategies after task execution. In two experiments the opportunity to engage in performance monitoring, respectively team self-correction, was varied systematically. Both performance monitoring as well as team self-correction appeared beneficial in the improvement of team performance. Teams that had the opportunity to engage in performance monitoring, however, performed better than teams that had the opportunity to engage in team self-correction.},

First, participants read 12 prose passages, which covered various general knowledge topics (e.g., The Sun) and ranged between 280 and 300 words in length. Next, they took an initial six-alternative, multiple-choice test on information contained in the passages. Feedback was given immediately for some of the multiple-choice items or after delay for other items. Participants were either shown the correct answer as feedback (standard feedback) or were allowed to keep answering until the correct answer was discovered (answer-until-correct feedback). Learning from the test was assessed on a delayed cued-recall test. The results indicated that delayed feedback led to superior final test performance relative to immediate feedback. However, type of feedback did not matter: discovering the correct answer through answer-until-correct feedback produced equivalent performance relative to standard feedback. This research suggests that delaying the presentation of feedback after a test is beneficial to learning because of the spaced presentation of information.},

Even human tutors face challenges in developing team cohesion, coordinating roles and assessing contributions.

Passive sensing methods offer the opportunity for the ITS to understand the team's cog- nitive and emotional state without interfering with the learning process.

abstract = {Trust plays an important role in the operation and management of virtual teams. It is also a foundation of
the cooperation between members. In the operation of a virtual team, trust estimation is a very significant
issue to know about the trustworthiness of each member and cooperation situations between members.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a decision support method for estimating the trust level. A
trust estimation framework with two dimensions of reputation and collaboration is developed. From this,
a fuzzy multiattribute decision analysis (MADA) approach based on the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation
model is proposed to measure the performances on reputation and collaboration. By the measurements
of the performances, the trust level of each member and the virtual team can be identified so as to
improve the management of the virtual team. Furthermore, a Web-based trust estimation system (WTES)
is designed and developed to support the activities of trust estimation in a virtual team. Finally, an application
is provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed decision support method},
annote = {Motivation: "It is also important how to design or develop a deci- sion support system since the trust estimation in a virtual team is a periodic activity that involves several decision procedures. Hence, to solve the above problems discussed, it is necessary to develop a new decision support method for estimating the trust level."


Conclusions:
-"This paper proposes a decision support method for estimatingthe trust level in a virtual team."

My thoughts: 
-I thinks this would be good to look into and try to empliment it if we can
-However, this is for virtual teams. So this would only work if we use virtual teams},

Many researchers now feel strongly that the ITSs would significantly improve performance if they could adapt to the affective state of the learner. This idea has spawned the developing field of affective tutoring systems (ATSs): ATSs are ITSs that are able to adapt to the affective state of students. However, ATSs are not widely employed in the tutoring system market. In this paper, a survey was conducted to investigate the critical factors affecting learner's satisfaction in ATSs based on an ATS developed by us. The results revealed that learner's attitude toward affective computing, agent tutor's expressiveness, emotion recognition accuracy, number of emotions recognized by agent tutor, pedagogical action and easy of the use of the system have significant influence on learner's satisfaction. The results indicate institutions how to further strengthen the ATSs' implementation.},

One hundred one undergraduate students (59 women and 42 men), aged 20-40, served as subjects in this experiment. They were requested to solve decision problems, using an interactive computer paradigm, while being exposed to controllable stress, uncontrollable stress, or no stress at all. There was no time constraint for the performance of the task. The controllability of the stressor was found to have no effect on the participants' performance. However, those who were exposed to either controllable or uncontrollable stress showed a significantly stronger tendency to offer solutions before all available alternatives had been considered and to scan their alternatives in a nonsystematic fashion than did participants who were not exposed to stress. In addition, patterns of alternative scanning were found to be correlated with the correctness of solutions to decision problems.},

Although a goal for researchers is to elucidate stress-coping mechanisms to facilitate decision-making processes, it is important to first understand the interaction between the state created by a stressful environment and how decisions are performed in such environments. The objective of this experiment was to probe the impact of exposure to acute stress on financial decision making and examine the particular influence of stress on decisions with a positive or negative valence. Participants' choices exhibited a stronger reflection effect when participants were under stress than when they were in the no-stress control phase. This suggests that stress modulates risk taking, potentially exacerbating behavioral bias in subsequent decision making. Consistent with dual-process approaches, decision makers fall back on automatized reactions to risk under the influence of disruptive stress.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, the use of agent-based technology within simulated training environments has increased. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) technology may include reactive or proactive simulation agents that monitor and support computer-based training without human tutors. Reactive agents are able to provide hints and feedback on trainee performance within static scenarios. Based on the trainee's competency and their progress toward training objectives, proactive ITS use computational methods in real-time to decide when to change content, complexity and/or instructional methods within a training scenario (Niehaus {\&} Riedl, 2009). This paper evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of reactive and proactive agents in computer-based tutoring systems; and discusses design considerations for the use of reactive and proactive agents in training simulations. Historically, intelligent tutoring agents have been simple, passive observers within simulation environments. These reactive agents monitor the trainee's progress and provide hints or other feedback only when there is sufficient variance from expected norms. Reactive agent actions are often based on simple heuristics or scripted behaviors. This can be desirable if the goal of the training is repeatability. However, reactive agents often know little about the trainee and the training context beyond performance data. Proactive agents have a higher computational cost in that they need to sense and understand more about the trainee, environment and training context, but are better able to predict trainee needs and adapt both feedback and scenario content. Complex military scenarios (e.g. ill-defined domains like bilateral negotiations) provide the opportunity to use more proactive agent techniques in assessing individual and team performance, and in adapting training scenarios to maintain challenge and flow},

However, there has been insufficient consideration of how drivers may respond to FCWS. This driving simulator study focused on alarm timing and its impact on driver response to alarm. The experimental investigation considered driver perception of alarm timings and its influence on trust at three driving speeds (40, 60 and 70 mile/h) and two time headways (1.7 and 2.2 s). The results showed that alarm effectiveness varied in response to driving conditions. Alarm promptness had a greater influence on ratings of trust than improvements in braking performance enabled by the alarm system. Moreover, alarms which were presented after braking actions had been initiated were viewed as late alarms. It is concluded that drivers typically expect alarms to be presented before they initiate braking actions and when this does not happen driver trust in the system is substantially decreased.},

On the basis of the literature regarding attentional capacity, constructive controversy, and truth-supported wins, the authors examined the effects of cognitive ability, workload distribution, Agreeableness, Openness to Experience, and structure on team learning. Results from 109 four-person project teams working on an interdependent command and control simulator indicated that teams learned more when composed of individuals who were high in cognitive ability and when the workload was distributed evenly. Conversely, team learning was negatively affected when teams were composed of individuals who were high in Agreeableness. Finally, teams using a paired structure learned more than teams structured either functionally or divisionally. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, as well as possible limitations and directions for future research.},

abstract = {When working as a member of a team, individuals must make decisions concerning the allocation of resources (e.g., effort) toward individual goals and team goals. As a result, individual and team goals, and feedback related to progress toward these goals, should be potent levers for affecting resource allocation decisions. This research develops a multilevel, multiple-goal model of individual and team regulatory processes that affect the allocation of resources across individual and team goals resulting in individual and team performance. On the basis of this model, predictions concerning the impact of individual and team performance feedback are examined empirically to evaluate the model and to understand the influence of feedback on regulatory processes and resource allocation. Two hundred thirty-seven participants were randomly formed into 79 teams of 3 that performed a simulated radar task that required teamwork. Results support the model and the predicted role of feedback in affecting the allocation of resources when individuals strive to accomplish both individual and team goals.},

Results from a study of 71 4-person teams performing a computerized tactical decision-making task suggest that the legitimacy of the need for back up has an important main effect on the extent to which team members provide assistance to and receive assistance from each other. In addition, the legitimacy of the need for back up also has important interactive effects with both the personality of the back up recipient and the personality of the back up providers on backing up behaviors in teams.},

These include propensity to trust, perceived trustworthiness, co-operative and lack of monitoring behaviours. A model was tested relating trust with perceived task performance, team satisfaction, and two dimensions of organisational commitment, i.e. attitudinal and continuance. Survey data from 112 teams(n ¼ 395) was collected in three social care institutions in The Netherlands. The results are supportive of a multi-component structure for trust and of its importance to the functioning of teams and organisations. Work team trust appeared strongly related with team member's attitudes towards the organisation. Trust between team members was positively associated with attitudinal commitment and negatively with continuance commitment. Trust was also positively related with perceived task performance and with team satisfaction. In addition, perceived task performance appeared strongly related to team satisfaction.},

-"With respect to the nature of trust, this study supports the conceptualisation of trust as a multi-component construct."

-"As suggested by Bigley and Pearce (1998), different components can be more important in some contexts than others, depending on the degree of familiarity between individuals and the degree of dependence."

-"Another limitation refers to the fact the teams in this study came from organisations within a single sector of activity, which makes it inappropriate to generalise these conclusions to other sectors of activity"

MY thoughts:
-This study was only 112 samples and is based on work teams. This should be kept in mind.

The 1st objective was to empirically examine an assumption found in several literatures—that a team's trust in its leader has a significant effect on the team's performance. The 2nd objective was to explore a more complex and dynamic relationship between trust and team performance whereby trust in leadership mediates the relationship between past team performance and future team performance. This relationship is derived by combining theories of trust with an attributional theory of leadership. Survey and archival data from a sample of men's college basketball teams provides support for both hypotheses, indicating that trust in leadership is both a product and a determinant of team performance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the operating room (OR), poor communication among the surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses may lead to adverse events that can compromise patient safety. A survey performed at our institution showed low communication ratings from surgeons, anesthesiologists, and OR nursing staff. Our objective was to determine if communication in the operating room could be improved through medical team training (MTT).

METHODS: A dedicated training session (didactic instruction, interactive participation, role-play, training films, and clinical vignettes) was offered to the entire surgical service using crew resource management principles. Attendees also were instructed in the principles of change management. A change team was formed to drive the implementation of the principles reviewed through a preoperative briefing conducted among the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and OR nurse. A validated Likert scale survey with questions specific to effective communication was administered to the nurses, anesthesiologists, and surgeons 2 months after the MTT to determine the impact on communication. Data are presented as mean +/- SEM.

RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the anesthesiologist and surgeon communication composite score after medical team training (anesthesia pre-MTT = 2.0 +/- .3, anesthesia post-MTT = 4.5 +/- .6, P {\textless}.0008; surgeons pre-MTT = 5.2 +/- .2, surgeons post-MTT = 6.6+/-.3, P {\textless}.0004; nurses pre-MTT = 4.3 +/- .3, nurses post-MTT = 4.2 +/- .4, P = .7).

CONCLUSIONS: Medical team training using crew resource management principles can improve communication in the OR, ensuring a safer environment that leads to decreased adverse events.},

We investigated which factors determine comfort/discomfort in using hand tools according to users. Therefore, descriptors of comfort/discomfort in using hand tools were collected from literature and interviews. After that, the relatedness of a selection of the descriptors to comfort in using hand tools was investigated. Six comfort factors could be distinguished (functionality, posture and muscles, irritation and pain of hand and fingers, irritation of hand surface, handle characteristics, aesthetics). These six factors can be classified into three meaningful groups: functionality, physical interaction and appearance. The main conclusions were that (1) the same descriptors were related to comfort and discomfort in using hand tools, (2) descriptors of functionality are most related to comfort in using hand tools followed by descriptors of physical interaction and (3) descriptors of appearance become secondary in comfort in using hand tools.},

However, many students have trouble knowing when to ask for help or they prefer to guess rather than ask for and read a hint. Is it better to give a hint when a student makes an error or wait until the student asks for a hint? This paper describes a study that compares giving hints proactively when students make errors to re- quiring students to ask for a hint when they want one. We found that students learned reliably more with hints-on-demand than proactive hints. This effect was especially evident for students who tend to ask for a high number of hints. There was not a significant difference between the two conditions for students who did not ask for many hints.},

abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) are an important class of statistical models that can be used to analyze correlated data. Such data are encountered in a variety of fields including biostatistics, public health, psychometrics, educational measurement, and sociology. This book aims to support a wide range of uses for the models by applied researchers in those and other fields by providing state-of-the-art descriptions of the implementation of LMMs in R. To help readers to get familiar with the features of the models and the details of carrying them out in R, the book includes a review of the most important theoretical concepts of the models. The presentation connects theory, software and applications. It is built up incrementally, starting with a summary of the concepts underlying simpler classes of linear models like the classical regression model, and carrying them forward to LMMs. A similar step-by-step approach is used to describe the R tools for LMMs. All the classes of linear models presented in the book are illustrated using real-life data. The book also introduces several novel R tools for LMMs, including new class of variance-covariance structure for random-effects, methods for influence diagnostics and for power calculations. They are included into an R package that should assist the readers in applying these and other methods presented in this text. Andrzej Ga{\l}ecki is a Research Professor in the Division of Geriatric Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, and Institute of Gerontology at the University of Michigan Medical School, and is Research Scientist in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. He earned his M.Sc. in applied mathematics (1977) from the Technical University of Warsaw, Poland, and an M.D. (1981) from the Medical University of Warsaw. In 1985 he earned a Ph.D. in epidemiology from the Institute of Mother and Child Care in Warsaw (Poland). He is a member of the Editorial Board of the Open Journal of Applied Sciences. Since 1990, Dr. Galecki has collaborated with researchers in gerontology and geriatrics. His research interests lie in the development and application of statistical methods for analyzing correlated and over- dispersed data. He developed the SAS macro NLMEM for nonlinear mixed-effects models, specified as a solution to ordinary differential equations. He also proposed a general class of variance-covariance structures for the analysis of multiple continuous dependent variables measured over time. This methodology is considered to be one of first approaches to joint models for longitudinal data.

abstract = {A renaissance in the research and development of computer-based, tutoring systems over the last ten years is motivating scientists to ponder the application of intelligent tutors and coaches in more challenging team training problem spaces where human tutors are either unavailable or impractical. This paper reviews some of the challenges and emerging technologies (tools and methods) that might influence the development of adaptive, intelligent tutors for geographically-distributed team training. Team tutoring presents many challenges. Even human tutors struggle to develop team cohesion, coordinate roles and responsibilities of team members and assess their contributions (Sottilare, 2010). Computer-based tutors face additional challenges: sensing and assessing the cognitive state (including affect) of each team member (Sottilare and Proctor, in press; D'Mello and Graesser, 2007) in near real-time to understand each team member's readiness to learn (e.g., their engagement and motivation); measuring team performance; perceiving and weighing team member contributions to team performance; and selecting instructional strategies that will optimize team performance. Emerging sensing technologies are showing promise as enablers of computer-based perception of each team member's behavior and physiology with the goal of predicting unobserved variables (e.g., cognitive state). Along with performance measures, historical and self-reported data, behavioral and physiological measures can provide the tutor with the information needed to model the trainee's state and their relationship with other team members and the tutor. Accurate (and timely) trainee and team state information (e.g., performance, competency, trust) are considered to be determining factors for the team tutor to select appropriate instructional strategies (e.g., support, direction) for optimal team performance. Design goals, ongoing experimentation, and potential applications of computer-based team tutors are also discussed.},

In order to investigate how trust plays out in this context, we conducted a qualitative study of 5 multi-national IT organizations. We interviewed 58 individuals across 10 countries and made two principal findings. First, study participants described trust in terms of their expectations of their colleagues. These expectations fell into one of three dimensions: that socially correct behavior will persist, that team members possess technical competency, and that individuals will demonstrate concern for others. Second, our study participants described trust as a dynamic process, with phases including formation, dissolution, adjustment and restoration. We provide new insights into these dimensions and phases of trust within distributed teams which extend existing literature. Our study also provides guidelines on effective practices within distributed teams in addition to providing implications for the extension of software engineering and collaboration tools.},

abstract = {Recent interruptions research suggests that the timing of interruptions can play a critical role in the level of task primary disruption. An unanswered question regarding interruption timing is whether greater task disruption in terms of primary task resumption time is experienced with more frequent interruptions. The present study used a VCR programming task with a pursuit-tracking interruption task to measure how quickly people resume the primary task after an interruption. The results showed that primary task resumption times were faster for more frequent interruptions, which was contrary to the predicted outcome. In addition, frequent interruptions did not result in the more resumption errors or longer time-on-task results as predicted. These results are discussed as evidence that more frequent interruptions may compel people to adopt aggressive goal maintenance strategies when dealing with interruptions, but further research is required to fully test this hypothesis.

We examine one behavioral measure of the disruption caused by task interruption, namely the resumption lag, or the time needed to “collect one's thoughts” and restart a task after an interruption is over. The resumption lag (in our task environment) was double the interval between uninterrupted actions (3.8 s vs. 1.9 s), indicating a substantial disruptive effect. To probe the nature of the disruption, we examined the role of external cues associated with the interrupted task, finding that cues available immediately before an interruption facilitate performance immediately afterwards (reducing the resumption lag).

The effectinvess of this methodology is dependent on the quality of performance measurement practices in place. Performance measurement during SBT must be diagnosed; that is, the causes of effective and ineffective performance must be deter- mined. This diagonstic measurement drives the systematic decisions concerning corrective feedback and remediation. The purpose of this article is to provide a state of the science review of human performance measurement systems in SBT. To this end, three specific goals are addressed. First, a review of the theoretical foundations being used to drive per- formance measurement systems in SBT is provided. Second, an overview of the method- ologies and approaches to measurement in SBT is provided. Third, a set of best practices for designing performance measurement systems for use in SBT are provided. These best practices are based on the scientific and practice-based literatures.},

The final part of the paper presents 8 tutorials of robust statistical methods using R that cover a range of variants of the GLM (t-tests, ANOVA, multiple regression, multilevel models, latent growth models).

abstract = {A total of 574 active workers from six different industrial sites were categorised into four force repetitive exposure groups. Workers in low force-low repetitive jobs served as an internal comparison population for the three other groups. Videotapes and surface electromyography were used to estimate hand force and repetitiveness. The presence of cumulative trauma disorders (CTD) was determined by structured interview and standardised non-invasive physical examination. Only workers who had been working on the study jobs for at least one year at the time of evaluation were eligible for selection. Categorisation of jobs and identification of CTDs were carried out independently by investigators who were appropriately blinded to exposure and outcome. The analysis of associations between CTDs and exposure categories were performed using Mantel-Haenszel plant adjusted odds ratios and unconditional multiple logistic regression. Significant positive associations were observed between hand wrist CTDs and high force-high repetitive jobs. These associations were independent of age, sex, years on the specific job, and plant.},

@article{Sottilare2011,
abstract = {A renaissance in the research and development of computer-based, tutoring systems over the last ten years is motivating scientists to ponder the application of intelligent tutors and coaches in more challenging team training problem spaces where human tutors are either unavailable or impractical. This paper reviews some of the challenges and emerging technologies (tools and methods) that might influence the development of adaptive, intelligent tutors for geographically-distributed team training. Team tutoring presents many challenges. Even human tutors struggle to develop team cohesion, coordinate roles and responsibilities of team members and assess their contributions (Sottilare, 2010). Computer-based tutors face additional challenges: sensing and assessing the cognitive state (including affect) of each team member (Sottilare and Proctor, in press; D'Mello and Graesser, 2007) in near real-time to understand each team member's readiness to learn (e.g., their engagement and motivation); measuring team performance; perceiving and weighing team member contributions to team performance; and selecting instructional strategies that will optimize team performance. Emerging sensing technologies are showing promise as enablers of computer-based perception of each team member's behavior and physiology with the goal of predicting unobserved variables (e.g., cognitive state). Along with performance measures, historical and self-reported data, behavioral and physiological measures can provide the tutor with the information needed to model the trainee's state and their relationship with other team members and the tutor. Accurate (and timely) trainee and team state information (e.g., performance, competency, trust) are considered to be determining factors for the team tutor to select appropriate instructional strategies (e.g., support, direction) for optimal team performance. Design goals, ongoing experimentation, and potential applications of computer-based team tutors are also discussed.},
